A theoretical approach was used to present the behavior of the system as based on the rules of thermodynamics for open heterogeneous systems. The tendency of human impact on the development of the system as well as changes in the level of sustainability were also speculated. The role for health promotion, quality of life, externalities and environmental quality in sustainable development were discussed and examples given. Finally, critical remarks as well as suggestions for multidisciplinary approach toward complexity of development problems and prerequisites of sustainable future were also presented.","INFORMATION; HEALTH","environment; sustainable development; thermodynamics; health promotion; safety","FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN","Dimitrov, BD##Iordanova, SI##Deliradeva, RP","Fac Med, Higher Med Inst, Dept Social Med, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ABRAMSON JH, 1988, MAKING SENSE DATA##ALLEN PM, 1993, EVOLUTION CREATIVITY##Babloyantz A., 1986, MOL DYNAMICS LIFE##BELLINGER EG, 1992, GEN PRINCIPLES BIOL##BERG GG, 1981, MEASUREMENT RISK##DEMOPOULOS HB, 1980, CANC ENV##DIMITROV BD, 1993, MED HYPOTHESES, V41, P425, DOI 10.1016/0306-9877(93)90119-B##Dimitrov BD, 1996, HEALTH PROMOT INT, V11, P253, DOI 10.1093/heapro/11.3.253##DIMITROV BD, 1995, CHAOS COMPLEXITY, P317##DIMITROV BD, 1991, BRIGHT INT MEL C BRI, P38##EBELING W, 1992, J NON-EQUIL THERMODY, V17, P303##Gordis L, 1988, EPIDEMIOLOGY HLTH RI##LAVE LB, 1982, QUANTITATIVE RISK AS##LEE N, 1989, 18 EIA CTR U MANCH D##Lowrance WW, 1976, ACCEPTABLE RISK##MACDONALD G, 1992, HEALTH PROMOT INT, V7, P71##Nicolis G., 1989, EXPLORING COMPLEXITY##PEARCE D, 1991, BLUEPRINT GREEN EC##Pearce D., 1990, EC NATURAL RESOURCES##PRENTICE RL, 1982, ENV EPIDEMIOLOGY RIS##REES A, 1992, REGULATED RIVERS RES, V7, P121##RODRIGUEZ E, 1995, HEALTH PROMOT INT, V10, P239, DOI 10.1093/heapro/10.3.239##SMITH CW, 1990, ELECTROMAGNETIC MAN##TURNBULL RG, 1992, ENV HLTH IMPACE ASSE##WAGENER DK, 1995, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V16, P105##WHITE KN, 1992, URBAN WATERSIDE REGE##Wildavsky A., 1989, SEARCHING SAFETY##Winpenny J.T., 1991, VALUES ENV GUIDE EC",0,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM16","no","SDG.3"

While these trends should be regarded as positive indications of individual sustainable development, or successful ageing, they also represent potential threats to success of global sustainable development. This paper presents a biodemographical analysis of the recent ageing trends, by discussing individual and global sustainable development in the context of the various biological processes responsible for increases in longevity. It then poses the possibility that an ageing population, by increasing the number of people dependent on environmental, medical, economic, and social resources, will make global sustainability more difficult to achieve, creating obstacles in the ability of future generations to meet their own resource needs. Ultimately, we suggest increasing independence and societal interdependence as solutions to intergenerational tensions and to the potential conflict between individual and global sustainable development.","OXIDATIVE STRESS; MITOCHONDRIA; RESTRICTION; EXPRESSION; LONGEVITY; LIFE; ACTIVATION; MUTATION; DISEASE; DAMAGE","ageing; demography; sustainable development; stress","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Kreps, SE##Mariethoz, E##Bakonyi, M##Polla, BS","Univ Paris 05, Lab Resp Physiol, URF Cochin Port Royal, F-75014 Paris, France.

The basic patterns of sustainable development do not appear to be evident at all spatial levels, owing to the absence of some capital stocks and the conversion processes linking them, but environmental economics theory can be generalized to explain phenomena at various levers. Capital conversion processes influencing the sustainability of development of spatial units are constrained by processes at different levels, e.g. those imposing environmental conditions on development or affecting availability of investment capital. The autonomy of individual spatial units is also compromised by capital transfers to and from other units at the same lever, so it is proposed that the sustainability of development of a particular unit should be estimated using net, rather than gross capital trends. Because of uneven development the same degree of sustainability should not be expected at the same time for all spatial units at the same spatial level.","GEOGRAPHY","sustainable development; scale; environmental economics","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Grainger, A","Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ADAMS R, 1997, FINANCIAL TIMES 1014, P14##ARROW KJ, 1970, SOCIAL CHOICE INDIVI##BEAUREGARD RA, 1995, WORLD CITIES WORLD S, P232, DOI DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511522192##BEBBINGTON A, 1990, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V80, P34, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1990.tb00002.x##Berry B.

This chapter marked the first time that mountains were recognised as a global priority, and led to a number of meetings on the topic of SMD, each of which produced a long list of priorities. The definition of SMD, and identification of indicators to evaluate success in achieving its objectives, are discussed. In order to move towards prioritisation of the concept in Europe, a questionnaire was sent to 249 respondents in 30 European countries asking for their perceptions of the importance of 36 variables linked to SMD, and of the performance of policies relating to each of these variables. The response rate was 47%. The results were analysed using importance-performance analysis, first for all respondents, and then comparing (1) respondents in Western vs. Central/Eastern Europe and (2) government vs. research/NGO respondents.

This conceptual work has largely ignored indigenous peoples' efforts to achieve self-determination and embark on development initiatives of their own. This paper argues that these grassroots initiatives have drawn on residual stocks of social/cultural capital for their impetus, and provide useful insights into problems of conceiving and operationalizing ""sustainable development."" Indigenous nations often espouse holistic frameworks broader than sustainable development models. They have had to address issues such as creating alternative governance structures, and how to incorporate holistic values into tribal development without jeopardizing business operations.

Sustainable development, a culture sensitive model, lends itself to reconciling competing cultures in a contemporary context driven by global demands for competition and consumerism on one extreme, while the other focuses almost exclusively on strict environmental protection. It further affirms the value of traditional or indigenous knowledge to complement modern knowledge. The paper suggests that educating for a sustainable future requires inclusion of six features: an interdisciplinary approach; teacher-training, pre- and in-service; curricula based on the three pillars of sustainable development; social and environmental justice; meaningful political participation; and respect for local and indigenous cultures.

There is now a burgeoning literature that examines sustainable development in the context of minerals and mining, most of which is concerned with sustainability at global and national scales. What is often challenging to ascertain, however, from these numerous perspectives on sustainable mineral extraction, minerals and metals recycling, environmental management, and social performance, is how sustainable development applies to mining companies themselves, and what steps a mine must take in order to improve the sustainability of operations. Since mining processes have the potential to impact a diverse group of environmental entities, and are of interest to a wide range of stakeholder groups, there is ample opportunity for the industry to operate more sustainably. Specifically, with improved planning, implementation of sound environmental management tools and cleaner technologies, extended social responsibility to stakeholder groups, the formation of sustainability partnerships, and improved training, a mine can improve performance in both the environmental and socioeconomic arenas, and thus contribute enormously to sustainable development at the mine level.

It was found that the factors that have emerged as challenges to sustainable tourism development related to priorities of national economic policy, the structure of public administration, an emergence of environmental issues, over commercialisation, and the structure of international tourism system. It concludes that although the principles of sustainable tourism development are beneficial, their implementation is an enormously difficult task to achieve and owing to the prevailing socio-economic and political conditions in the developing world. Hence, any operation of principles of sustainable tourism development necessitates hard political and economic choices, and decisions based upon complex socio-economic and environmental trade-offs. Moreover, it states that implementation of these hard decisions may not be possible unless international organisations encourage and collaborate with governments of developing countries to implement the principles of sustainable tourism development.

The ""old"" Kerala model, preoccupied with redistributive policies, failed, however, to induce economic development. As a result, attention is now being given to a ""new"" Kerala model. The new policy explicitly seeks reconciliation of social, productive and environmental objectives at the local level, and tries to develop synergies between civil society, local governmental bodies and the stale government. The new Kerala model thus holds important lessons for participatory, community based sustainable development in India and elsewhere. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The concept of sustainable development provides an expanded domain for critical systems thinking. The fundamental values underpinning sustainable development are that both intragenerational and intergenerational equity are important. As a consequence, key stakeholders are often excluded from power-sharing within current social systems. Addressing these issues requires renewed focus on emancipatory commitment and methodologies. To date, Ulrich's critical systems heuristics is the only critical systems methodology that offers practicable tools for emancipation. A case study analysis in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, provides insights in relation to the application of critical system heuristics to issues of sustainable development and highlights the need to extend the use of critical systems heuristics beyond the design and monitoring of structured interventions.","THINKING","emancipation; critical systems; critical systems heuristics; sustainable development; Ethiopia","SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH","Maru, YT##Woodford, K",NA,"Management","Business & Economics","BAKKES J, 1997, SUSTAINABILITY INDIC, P379##BROCKLESBY J, 1993, NEW OPERATIONAL RES##Burrel G., 1979, SOCIOLOGICAL PARADIG##CHAMBERS R, 1997, POWER PARTICIPATORY, P30##Churchman C.

On the one hand, it addresses economic growth, and on the other, it deals with economic development of the whole nation. Sustainable development, on the other hand, emphasizes the need for integration of economics and environment, as well as promoting intra- and intergenerational equity. While the literature deals extensively with the issues of sustainable development, it lacks a prescription of an easy-to-use, yet rigorous, methodology for it. In this paper, we offer a decision conferencing approach to sustainable development planning based on a multicriteria model. The integrated model is presented and applied to a sustainable development planning exercise in a third world country. Sample results are presented and detailed sensitivity analyses show the environmental variables that are of major concern. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This emerging field offers both a firm theoretical basis (based upon recent developments in physics, biology, dynamic systems theory and the sciences of complexity) and practical, pragmatic answers to the implementation of a sustainable path of development. This is further illustrated with the presentation of the evolutionary logic of a multi-level common regime. Such a regime could be an institutional counterpart of social and environmental dynamics.

Assessment methods that exist so far usually only use an indicator system for making sustainable judgement. These indicators rarely reflect dynamic characteristics. However, sustainable development is influenced by changes in the social-economic system and in the eco-environmental system at different times. Besides the spatial character, sustainable development has a temporal character that can not be neglected; therefore the research system should also be dynamic. This paper focuses on this dynamic trait, so that the assessment results obtained provide more information for judgements in decision-making processes. Firstly the dynamic characteristics of sustainable development are analyzed, which point to a track of sustainable development that is an upward undulating curve. According to the dynamic character and the development rules of a social, economic and ecological system, a flexible assessment approach that is based en tendency analysis, restrictive conditions and a feedback system is then proposed for sustainable development.",NA,"sustainable development; assessment; dynamic analysis","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Shi, XQ","Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Dept Syst Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Azar C, 1996, ECOL ECON, V18, P89, DOI 10.1016/0921-8009(96)00028-6##DAVID PL, 1997, ENVIRON MANAGE, V21, P23##*DEP ENV, 1996, GOV STAT SERV IND SU##NIU WY, 1993, ENVIRON MANAGE, V17, P179, DOI 10.1007/BF02394688##PEARCE D, 1989, BLUEPRINT GREEN EC, P14##ROEGEN G, 1976, FOREWORD ENERGY EC M, P19##SHI XQ, 1998, P INT C SYST SCI SYS, P485##Smith CS, 1998, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V52, P15, DOI 10.1006/jema.1997.0162##*UCSD, 1995, IND SUST DEV DEC MAK, P24##*UN, 1996, UN IND SUST DEV FRAM, P40##World Bank, 1997, WORLD BANK IND ENV S##World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), 1987, REPORT WORLD COMMISS, DOI 10.1080/07488008808408783",12,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM2","no","SDG.9"

It has been fueled by cheap fossil fuel energy so energy consumption has risen rapidly, but there are signs that negative feedbacks in the form of waste and inefficiency may affect future development. If energy throughput exceeds the capacity of the environment to process the inevitable waste from production then the development may not be sustainable. We calculate economic diversity using an energy flow network analysis method to explore the relationships of development policy, energy use, efficiency and sustainable development. China and its provinces are presented as a case study and the development status of each province in China is presented. China's development policy does not appear to be sustainable over the period 1985-1998 because of unsustainable energy consumption trends and declining economic diversity. An energy consumption tax is proposed for increasing diversity and dealing with increasing energy consumption in China. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, this rather tricky term is open to a number of interpretations ranging from strong/ecological to weak/technocratic. In the context of an old industrial region, evidence of movement towards strong sustainable development in four areas is discussed: radicalising democracy; promoting the local social economy; meeting basic needs; and encouraging biodiversity. The article explores why, in the light of sustained evidence of multiple social and environmental crises, these messages of strong, ecological sustainable development continue to be ignored and marginalized in formulating policy at the regional level.","ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT","ecology; radical democracy; sustainable development; regional policy","REGIONAL STUDIES","Chatterton, P","Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.","Economics; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning","Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration","AHLQUIST D, 1999, LOCAL EC         FEB, P339##Atkinson R, 1999, URBAN STUD, V36, P59, DOI 10.1080/0042098993736##BERRY W, 2001, RESURGENCE, V206, P24##bookchin Murray, 1992, URBANIZATION CITIES##BROWN LR, 2000, VITAL SIGNS 2000 ENV##Chatterton P., 2001, LOCAL ENVIRON, V6, P439, DOI DOI 10.1080/13549830120091725##CLAVAL P, 1998, INTRO REGIONAL GEOGR##COSTANZA R, 1992, CONSERV BIOL, V6, P37, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.610037.x##COULSON A, 1999, LOCAL EC         NOV, P194##Counsell D., 1999, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, V42, P45, DOI 10.1080/09640569911299##Daly H.

"J","WOS:000179796700001",2002,"Evolution, variability and sustainable development","Sustainable development is a global challenge to science and society. In politics and economics the concepts for establishing a sustainable society are numerous, nonetheless necessary interdisciplinary approaches are still marginalised. Trying to foster a deeper communication between biology and social science, an evolutionary perspective on sustainable development is offered. Subsequently, the role of variability and diversity in evolution is highlighted. Hereby, special attention is devoted, among other things, to the links between variability and stability in the long term. Next, selection and variability are emphasised in the cultural context. This is followed by general implications for sustainability. In contrast to strategies aiming at short-term optimisation and economic efficiency, we argue that the conditions and circumstances maintaining variability and momentary sub-optimal alternatives are highly relevant for a socio-economic system that is heading for sustainable development.","EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; DIVERSITY; STABILITY; ECONOMICS; COMMUNITIES; ENERGETICS; EXCLUSION; DYNAMICS; RESOURCE; SCALE","adaptation; evolution; risk minimisation; selection; short-term optimisation; sustainable development; variability","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Rammel, C##Staudinger, M","Univ Vienna, Inst Ecol & Conservat Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","AGREN GI, 1984, OIKOS, V43, P369, DOI 10.2307/3544155##ALLAND A, 1973, HDB SOCIAL CULTURAL, P143##Altvater E., 1997, GRENZEN GLOBALISIERU##ATKINSON WD, 1981, J ANIM ECOL, V50, P461, DOI 10.2307/4067##AXELROD R, 1981, SCIENCE, V211, P1390, DOI 10.1126/science.7466396##Axelrod R., 1984, EVOLUTION COOPERATIO##BAHN PG, 1992, EASTER ISLAND EARTH##Bandura A., 1986, SOCIAL FDN THOUGHT A##Barnett H.G., 1953, INNOVATION BASIS CUL##Bauer L., 1988, GEBURT NEUZEIT FEUDA##Baumol W., 1988, THEORY ENV POLICY##Biersack A, 1999, AM ANTHROPOL, V101, P68, DOI 10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.68##Biersack A, 1999, AM ANTHROPOL, V101, P5, DOI 10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.5##Boserup E., 1965, CONDITIONS AGR GROWT##Boserup E, 1981, POPULATION TECHNOLOG##Boyd R., 1985, CULTURE EVOLUTIONARY##BOYD R, 1999, ETHOL SOCIOBIOL, V113, P171##BRYNE R, 1989, MACIAVELLIAN INTELLI##Buenstorf G, 2000, ECOL ECON, V33, P119, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00133-0##CAMPBELL DT, 1991, ZYGON, V26, P91, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9744.1991.tb00804.x##CARRITHERS M, 1992, WHY HUMANS HAVE CULT##Cavalli-Sforza L.

Results indicated that the emergy indices are simplified and merged, and a new emergy index for sustainable development( EISD) is deduced. Employing EISD, two cases are conducted. The first one is to compare three different dike-pond agro-ecological engineering modes, which are: melon-melon-cabbage-four domestic fishes ( mode I), melon-melon-cabbage-pig-four domestic fishes ( mode II) and melon- melon-cabbage- pig-four domestic fishes combined with Siniperca chuatsi B. ( mode III). The result is that the EISD of mode I is 0.53. Mode II ' s EISD is 5.26 times of mode I, and mode III's EISD is 6.83 times of mode I. The second one is to evaluate the development of Zhongshan City, Pearl Delta, during 1996 to 2000. The result indicated that the EISD of Zhongshan had appreciably declined from 1996 to 1998, and quickly improved from 1998 to 2000, partly because of its environment protection and product construction. Both of the two cases studies showed that EISD can assessment the sustainable development ability more roundly, with the consideration of environmental impact and social-economic effect at the same time.",NA,"indices; emergy; sustainable development","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Lu, HF##Lan, SF##Li, L##Peng, SL","Chinese Acad Sci, S China Inst Bot, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.

This double interpretation (1) embraces the restraint principle and the argument that no individual can claim an unconditional right to destroy environmental goods as a baseline that could justify directive strategies for government intervention in non-sustainable lifestyles, and (2) suggests that people's concerns about the deterioration of nature and the environment articulate future-oriented narratives of self-identity that could fuel non-directive strategies to develop further responsibilities towards nearby future generations. Sustainable development, thus, provides sound arguments to restrict people's freedom to follow their own lifestyles, when these lifestyles transgressed the baseline of the restraint principle. However, the individual freedom of choice should not be restricted for any further environmental considerations. Non-directive strategies are thus to stimulate the development of such further responsibilities towards nearby future generations.","ETHICS","future generations; ideals; justice; sustainable development","JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS","Beekman, V","Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2502 LS The Hague, Netherlands.","Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Ethics; Environmental Sciences; History & Philosophy Of Science","Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; History & Philosophy of Science","ARRLER F, 1999, SAP ISEE MOR POL REA##Barry Brian, 1999, FAIRNESS FUTURITY ES, P93##Bauman Z., 1989, MODERNITY HOLOCAUST##Beck Ulrich, 1988, GEGENGIFTE ORG UNVER##Beckerman W, 1999, FAIRNESS FUTURITY ES, P71##Calvino I., 1981, WINTERS NIGHT TRAVEL##COESEL M, 1997, NJN EEN GEMEENSCHAP##De-Shalit A., 1995, WHY POSTERITY MATTER##Dobson A., 1998, JUSTICE ENV CONCEPTI##ENGLISH J, 1977, PHILOS STUD, V31, P91, DOI 10.1007/BF01857179##Gert Bernard, 1998, MORALITY ITS NATURE##Giddens A., 1994, LEFT RIGHT FUTURE RA##Giddens A., 1991, MODERNITY SELF IDENT##Giddens Anthony, 1990, CONSEQUENCES MODERNI##GOLDING MP, 1972, MONIST, V56, P85, DOI 10.5840/monist197256118##HARDIN G, 1968, SCIENCE, V162, P1243, DOI 10.1126/science.162.3859.1243##Hickman Larry, 1996, ENV PRAGMATISM, P50##KORTHALS M, 2000, FOOD ETHICS REV, V1##LIGHT A, 2002, PRAGMATIST ETHICS TE, P77##Light A., 1996, ENV PRAGMATISM, P325##Manning R., 1981, ENVIRON ETHICS, V3, P155, DOI [10.5840/enviroethics19813240, DOI 10.5840/ENVIROETHICS19813240]##MARGADANTVANARC.MJ, 1988, DIERENJUF NATUUREDUC##Norton B., 1999, FAIRNESS FUTURITY ES, P118##NORTON B, 1996, ENV PRAGMATISM, P84##Norton B.

For this, first we need to know how this concept is applied in some developing countries. In this paper we present some Mexican experiences in the field of capacity building for Sustainable development. The main problems are the monodisciplinary training of the specialists, the absence of a sound policy for promotion, career development and assessment of researchers, as well as of their projects when they are interdisciplinary and development-oriented. The main proposals to solve these problems are the creation of mechanisms that foster and legitimize interdisciplinary work; a decentralized planning process with the specific objective of establishing the needs and orientations on a regional basis; provide resources to long-term projects, and finally, consensus on asking international funding agencies for stronger support for public higher education institutions in developing countries in order to increase and strengthen their capacity for education and research in general, and in the field of SID in particular.","ENVIRONMENT","capacity building; sustainable development; interdisciplinarity; Mexico","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Ceccon, E##Cetto, AM","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Reg Invest Multidisciplinarias, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico.

An Examination of Sustainable Development Provisions in UK and Scottish Statutes","This article examines the use of the term 'sustainable development' in Acts of the Scottish and UK Parliaments. It begins by examining the UK's traditional reluctance to legislate on sustainable development, the more recent reversal of that approach and some definitional issues surrounding the term. It then moves on to consider the sustainable development provisions in detail examining their form, strength and limits, and how they can be monitored, reviewed and enforced both inside and outside court. The article concludes that over and above any symbolic value, in many instances the provisions also have legal significance. The formulations vary and while some are simply material considerations to be used in decision-making, those which set out mandatory requirements such as reports do create binding legal rules. Furthermore, there are a few examples where the duty or objective is set out as a clear legal rule that could be interpreted as providing a framework for decision-making.",NA,"sustainable development; statutes; duties; Scotland","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW","Ross, A","Univ Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.","Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Law; Multidisciplinary Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law; Science & Technology - Other Topics","Alder J., 1999, ENV LAW ETHICS, P141##[Anonymous], 2003, J ENVIRON LAW, V15, P59##Blowers A., 1992, TOWN COUNTRY PLANN, V61, P132##BOSSELMAN K, 2002, ENV LAW SUSTAINABLE##BRANDL E, 1992, HARVARD ENVIRON LAW, V16, P1##BRANDL E, 1992, HARV ENV LR, V16, P92##*CAG CONS, 2004, 10 CAG CONS ENV RUR, V2##*CAG CONS, 2003, EFF HAS NAT ASS WAL##COLLAR N, 1970, 1WLR, V1, P1281##Curran S.

"J","WOS:000208284700002",2009,"Directing clean development mechanism towards developing countries' sustainable development priorities","Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), sustainable development is considered a country context-specific aspect which differs across countries. Actual CDM practice has shown that projects are largely initiated by the demand for relatively low-cost certified emission reductions, leading to a series of ad-hoc projects, rather than serving the overall host countries' sustainable development needs and priorities. In the above framework, the study aims to direct CDM towards national sustainable development priorities, through the identification of sustainable energy technology priorities for electricity generation in five examined developing countries, namely Chile, China, Israel, Kenya and Thailand. The current approach lays emphasis on the formulation of the process so as to be relatively straightforward to incorporate direct experts' preferences as well as trying to deal with the needs of flexibility and validity, through the use of an existing Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, namely the ELECTRE TRI method.

"J","WOS:000208399700008",2010,"Competences for sustainable development and sustainability Significance and challenges for ESD","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw attention of the education for sustainable development (ESD) community to recent discussions on competence approaches and to examine the adequacy of a competence-based model as the means of achieving educational and societal transformation towards sustainability. The paper analyses and highlights some important aspects of case studies of the contributing authors to the special issue. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the review of relevant literature and reflections on the articles that constitute this special issue. It also reflects the authors' observations through their extensive interactions with theoreticians, practitioners and policy makers on ESD in the context of the United Nations decade of education for sustainable development (DESD) and higher education for sustainable development (HESD). Findings - The paper recognises a highly complex nature of the conceptualizations of competences for SD and their articulation in educational programmes. It also highlights a growing interest in competence-based approaches from institutions of higher education and their stakeholders in different parts of the world. Practical implications - The paper provides a broad picture of influential international processes and diverse players driving competence-based approaches in ESD and indicates a need for more coherent critical multi-level analysis of such processes. Originality/value - The paper contributes to a broader debate on strategies of implementation of ESD and education for sustainability (EfS) by mapping arguments on competences for SD and sustainability with a particular focus on higher education institutions.","EDUCATION","Competences; Higher education; Sustainable development; Societal organization","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Mochizuki, Y##Fadeeva, Z","[Mochizuki, Yoko; Fadeeva, Zinaida] United Nations Univ, Educ Sustainable Dev Programme, Inst Adv Studies, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Education & Educational Research","[Anonymous], 2007, LIQUID TIMES LIVING##Barth M., 2007, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V8, P416, DOI [10.1108/1467637071082358, DOI 10.1108/14676370710823582, 10.1108/14676370710823582]##Beck U., 1992, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI##Beck U., 2009, WORLD RISK##Breidlid A, 2009, INT J EDUC DEV, V29, P140, DOI 10.1016/j.ijedudev.2008.09.009##Brundiers K, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P308, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077540##De Haan G., 2006, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V1, P19, DOI [10.1080/13504620500526362, DOI 10.1080/13504620500526362]##Elliot J, 2007, KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION, P142##Fadeeva Z, 2010, SUSTAIN SCI, V5, P249, DOI 10.1007/s11625-010-0106-0##Hopkinson P, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P365, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077586##International Commission on Education for Sustainable Development Practice, 2008, FIN REP INT COMM ED##KEEN M, 2005, SOCIAL LEARNING ENV##Kok A, 2008, ASIA PACIFIC FU 1117##Lotz-Sisitka H., 2009, UNEVOC TECHNICAL VOC, V8, P308##Mogensen F, 2010, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V16, P59, DOI 10.1080/13504620903504032##OECD, 2008, SUMM REP OECD WORKSH##OECD, 2005, DEF SEL KEY COMP EX##Parker J, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P325, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077559##Podger DM, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P339, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077568##Readings B., 1996, U RUINS##Schley, 2008, NECESSARY REVOLUTION##Schwarzin L, 2010, CROSS BOUNDARY TRANS##Sen A, 2001, DEV FREEDOM##Sleurs W., 2008, COMPETENCIES ESD ED##Smith MK, 1996, COMPETENCE COMPETENC##Stevens C., 2008, OECD WORK COMPETENCI##TUNING Educational Structures in Europe, 2007, TUNING GEN BROCH##UNECE, 2009, 4 M UNECE STEER COMM##UNESCO, 2005, ED DESD 2005 PI 01##UNESCO [United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization], 1996, LEARNING TREASURE##v Rosenstiel L., 2003, HDB KOMPETENZMESSUNG##Wals AEJ, 2007, SOCIAL LEARNING SUST##Wals AEJ, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P380, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077595",130,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM8","no","SDG.12#SDG.17"
"J","WOS:000208763700001",2011,"Sustainable Development: A Bird's Eye View","At the turn of the millennium, the world's political leadership adopted sustainable development as a leading model for societal development. However, the terms ""sustainable development"", ""sustainability"" and ""sustainable"" are sometimes over-and misused despite wide consensus about the concept's meaning among sustainability scholars and practitioners. While the concept allows various sustainability views to co-exist, random conceptualizations which do not respect the fundamental sustainability principles undermine the concept's objective to steer action. This lack of understanding of sustainability arguably inhibits its practical realization and a proper understanding of sustainability is urgently needed. In this paper we aim to contribute to a better understanding of sustainability by adopting a bird's eye perspective. We review the rich contemporary literature, with a specific focus on the terminology, genesis, fundamental principles, mainstream views of sustainability, and several governing aspects. Further, using the evolving body of sustainability literature, the paper provides arguments to combat common misconceptions of sustainability.","PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; GOVERNANCE; RESILIENCE; IDEA","sustainable development; sustainability; meaning; principles; history; governance","SUSTAINABILITY","Waas, T##Huge, J##Verbruggen, A##Wright, T","[Waas, Tom; Huge, Jean] Vrije Univ Brussel, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.

In this sense, education is one of the strongest tools to model our future and a key factor of cultural change. One of the principal aims of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is to develop cognitive and affective skills that affect people's values, such as empathy and critical thinking. Together with compromise and responsibility towards a group, it is possible to build new values and ways to interact with both people and the environment. In the present study we used positive psychology principles in creating teaching interventions to empower empathy and critical thinking through an ESD programme at a Chilean primary school. The results show that an intervention of this kind helps to harmoniously build reflective thinking and empathy within students. This enables them to achieve important changes in their disposition to make sound personal and environmental decisions, and prepares them to positively meet imposing present and future challenges.",NA,"sustainable development; education for sustainable development; positive psychology; critical thinking; empathy","LOCAL ENVIRONMENT","Ampuero, DA##Miranda, C##Goyen, S","[Ampuero, David Andres] Dept Educ, Los Andes, Chile.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Utilizing a systematic review of literature between 1977 and 2013 about CSR and sustainability definitions and theories to reveal knowledge fragmentation in the use of the social domain and its implications within sustainable development. Findings - Identifies the gaps of the social domain in sustainable development and raises awareness to advance sustainable development beyond current sustainable development strategies, initiatives and practices. The pertinent publications from the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the systematic literature review were analyzed to determine how the social domain is used and interpreted in CSR and sustainability. Based upon the findings, four themes represent the social domain as socio-economics, stakeholders, societal well-being and social sustainability with suggestions for further research. Research limitations/implications - The systematic literature review searched one academic search engine and focussed on journals and books written in English. Originality/value - The contribution of the paper highlights, first, how an underdeveloped social domain can contribute toward multiple meanings of sustainable development and the social domain's untapped capacity to develop a clearer standard definition of sustainable development and second, the potential to advance competitive advantage for corporations and governments.","CORPORATE PERFORMANCE; RESPONSIBILITY; BUSINESS; ACCOUNTABILITY; CITIZENSHIP; ORIENTATION; COMMUNITY; STRATEGY; CSR","Sustainable development; Social responsibility; Competitive advantage; Corporate social reporting","WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Thiel, M","[Thiel, Monica] Tilburg Univ, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Tilburg, Netherlands.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology","Science & Technology - Other Topics","Adams C., 2004, AUSTR ACCOUNTING REV, V14, P31, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.1835-2561.2004.TB00238.X##Aguilera RV, 2007, ACAD MANAGE REV, V32, P836, DOI 10.5465/AMR.2007.25275678##Alkhafaji A.F., 1989, STAKEHOLDER APPROACH##Amaeshi K.

"J","WOS:000221330100001",2004,"The impact of clean development mechanism in achieving sustainable development","The flexible mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, the clean development mechanism (CDM), should fulfil a twin objective: cost-effective greenhouse gas mitigation and enhancement of sustainable development in developing countries. As most host CDM countries have not established the proper institutional capacity to approve CDM projects and, at the same time, are prerogative to define sustainable development criteria for CDM projects, there is a clear need for a single set of guidelines or one evaluation system that accounts both climate and sustainable development considerations in the approval process of CDM projects.

Although the concept was first introduced in response to environmental concerns, it has been defined primarily by the mainstream tradition of economic analysis, which tends to marginalize the issue of ecological sustainability itself Recently, however scholars advancing various critical perspectives challenged the mainstream economic analysis of sustainable development. This essay examines the presuppositions, logic, and major themes of mainstream sustainable development theory, primarily within economics, and explores the critiques of mainstream analysis offered by various poststructuralist cultural theorists and ecological Marxists. Although considered to tie superior in their greater emphasis on ecological sustainability, neither of these critical approaches is deemed adequate in itself. The argument here instead leads to the conception that an adequate approach to sustainable development requires combining insights from various critical approaches and perspectives.",NA,"sustainable development; poverty; environment; Agenda 21; World Bank","ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT","Castro, CJ","Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.","Environmental Studies; Management","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics","Adams W.

The objective of this paper is to examine the outcomes of the Summit on energy, and to assess them against proposals to address the lack of access to modern energy and the need to move toward a cleaner energy system. We find that lack of political leadership from key countries prevented agreement not only on targets for renewable energy, but also on a programme to promote access. The achievements of the Summit were limited to enabling activities such as capacity building and technology transfer, rather than substantive agreements. While WSSD put energy higher on the agenda than before, no institutional home or programme to take the issues forward has emerged. This therefore remains a critical challenge to be addressed. Achieving this broad goal will require building a coalition to promote cleaner energy, and committing resources to programme for energy access. Based on analysis of proposals and the negotiations, we propose several key areas where progress is still possible and necessary, including: shifting more international public and private energy financing toward access investments and cleaner energy investments, advancing regional approaches to access and renewable energy targets, and a range of mechanisms to strengthen institutional capacity for integrating energy and Sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000224031500003",2004,"Recent developments, in stochastic MPC and sustainable development","Despite the extensive literature that exists on predictive control and robustness to uncertainty, both multiplicative (e.g. parametric) and additive (e.g. exogenous), very little attention has been paid to the case of stochastic uncertainty. Yet this arises naturally in many control applications, for example when models are identified using least squares procedures. More generally, stochastic uncertainty is a salient feature in other key areas of human endeavour, such as sustainable development. Sustainability refers to the strategy of encouraging development at current time without compromising the potential for development in the future. Inevitably, modelling the effects of sustainable development policy over a horizon of say 30 years involves a very significant random element, which has to be taken into account when assessing the optimality of any proposed policy. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is ideally suited for generating constrained optimal solutions and as such would be an ideal tool for policy assessment. However, this calls first for suitable extensions to the stochastic case. The aim of this paper is to review some of the recent advances in this area, and to provide a pilot study that demonstrates the efficacy of stochastic predictive control as a tool for assessing policy in a sustainable development problem concerning allocation of public research and development budgets between alternative power generation technologies. This problem has been considered in earlier work, but only in the context of a single-shot, open-loop optimisation. Similarly, the consideration of stochastic predictive control methodologies has previously been restricted to general hypothetical control problems. The current paper brings together this body of work, proposes suitable extensions, and concludes with a closed-loop study of predictive control applied to a sustainable development policy assessment problem.

Key ingredients in sustainable development problems are the presence of random effects and the conflict between different objectives. To accommodate these, the earlier formulation was strongly stochastic and was posed in a multi-objective framework. The purpose of this paper is to consider the extension of the work to a formulation that deploys dynamic optimisation. In particular it is the aim here to use simulations based on a large scale model to derive dynamic rather than static representations, to integrate these into the optimisation scheme and to assess the benefits.

Data for this project pertain to Canadian firms in the oil and gas, mining, and forestry industries from 1986 to 1995. I find that both resource-based and institutional factors influence corporate sustainable development. By exploring time-related effects, I also find that media pressures were important in early periods and resource-based opportunities endured over time. This finding challenges the assumption that firms first adopt innovations in response to technical rewards which are later institutionalized. These counter-intuitive results may be attributable to the unique characteristics of the dependent variable, corporate sustainable development. They raise important questions and directions for future research.

"J","WOS:000227957400004",2005,"Delivering sustainability therapy in Sustainable Development projects","This paper explores the apparent contradiction between the 'linearity' of most Sustainable Development projects, with time-bound and defined outputs achieved at a fixed cost, and an implied 'circularity' of the theory whereby there is no 'end'. Projects usually have clear parameters within which they are implemented, and the inclusion of elements such as the need for accountability, measurable impact and,value for money' have grown in importance. It could be argued that we live in a 'projectified' and therefore linear world. The paper explores the potential contradiction between 'linearity' and 'circularity', and suggests that one way around this is to frame the project within a form of the Kolb Learning Cycle heuristic. This will facilitate a rationalisation from those implementing the sustainable development project as to why decisions are being made and for whom. If these questions are opened up to the project stakeholders, including beneficiaries, then the Kolb cycle could encourage learning and understanding by all involved. It could also provide Sustainability Therapy to those trapped in processes, which they find orthogonal to their own perceptions. It is suggested that such learning, therapy and reflective practice should be a valid output of the sustainable development project, although typically the focus is only upon the final outputs and how they feed into policy. Ironically funders would be well advised to take a broader perspective in order to achieve true 'value for money' within such projects, even if learning is not an easily measurable or tangible outcome. These points are explored within the context of the wider literature and experience with a sustainable development project undertaken in Malta. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a Foucaudian perspective, we uncover and highlight the importance of discourse in the development of societal context which could lead to the radical change in our epistemological thought necessary for Sustainable Development to reach its potential. By developing an argument for an epistemological change, we suggest that business organizations have an ethical responsibility towards revaluating Sustainable Development, leading to a discourse based on an integrated inclusive process of celebrating diversity in all its forms. The paper goes on to explore the argument for such a change. This exploration is based on three issues: the notion of over simplification in the promotion of development; the idea of an imbalance in the interaction of business and government operating in the larger context of society; and the notion of increasing responsibility with increasing influence in terms of the business organization within society. Having established the argument for an ethical choice by business organizations, we then reflect on how such a change could be incorporated into an organization.",NA,"sustainable development; epistemology; values; ethics; Foucault; business","JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS","Fergus, AHT##Rowney, JIA","Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.","Business; Ethics","Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics","Alvesson M., 1996, MAKING SENSE MANAGEM##ALVESSON M, 1993, COMMUNICATION POWER##Bruntland G.

The term Sustainable Development had the potential, we argue, to stimulate discursive engagement with respect to the future development of society within an ethical framework based around the values of inclusivity, diversity, and integration. The importance of philosophical context within which the term is used influences the definitional process of meaning, and has been simulated into the language of the dominant scientific-economic paradigm. We go on to explore how this meaning change has come about. In doing so we looked to the Enlightenment period and the resulting philosophies to explore the foundations of meaning, and then to the work of Jurgen Habermas to explain how the scientific-economic paradigm came to dominate the meaning of Sustainable Development.",NA,"sustainable development; scientific-economic paradigm; philosophy; habermas; values; relationships","JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS","Fergus, AHT##Rowney, JIA","Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.","Business; Ethics","Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics","ALVESSON M, 1993, J MANAGE STUD, V30, P997, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.1993.tb00476.x##ALVESSON M, 1996, COMMUNICATION POWER##Alvesson M., 2000, DOING CRITICAL MANAG##BARBIER EB, 1987, ENVIRON CONSERV, V14, P101, DOI 10.1017/S0376892900011449##Blackburn S., 1999, THINK##*BRIT BROADC CORP, 2003, PRESS MOUNTS TERROR##BRUNTLAND GH, 1987, COMMON FUTURE WORLD##Capra F., 1975, TAO PHYS##Daly Herman E, 1996, GROWTH##DAVIS W, 2001, LIGHT EDGE WORLD##ERIBON D, 1992, M FOUCAULT##Esty DC, 2001, FOREIGN POLICY, P74, DOI 10.2307/3183263##GLADWIN TN, 1995, ACAD MANAGE REV, V20, P874, DOI 10.5465/amr.1995.9512280024##Habermas J., 1987, THEORY COMMUNICATIVE, V2##Habermas J., 1984, THEORY COMMUNICATIVE, V1##Habermas J, 1971, RATIONAL SOC##Hamilton C, 2002, ECOL ECON, V42, P89, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00051-4##HARMAN W, 1975, VITAL SPEECHES DAY, V42, P147##HAROLD AI, 1951, BIAS COMMUNICATION##HART SL, 1995, ACAD MANAGE REV, V20, P986, DOI 10.2307/258963##HAWKEN P, 1993, UTNE READER      SEP, P54##KINGWELL M, 2000, WORLD WE WANT RESTOR##Lawson T., 1997, EC REALITY##LELE SM, 1991, WORLD DEV, V19, P607, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(91)90197-P##Luckmann, 1973, STRUCTURES LIFE WORL, V1##Meadows D., 1974, LIMITS GROWTH REPORT##Midgley Mary, 1992, SCI SALVATION MODERN##MITCHAM C, 1995, TECHNOL SOC, V17, P311, DOI 10.1016/0160-791X(95)00008-F##NATALE SM, 1983, J BUS ETHICS, V2, P43, DOI 10.1007/BF00382712##Parsons T., 1977, SOCIAL SYSTEMS EVOLU##POSTEL S, 1992, LAST OASIS FACING WA##REDCLIFT M, 1992, GEOFORUM, V23, P395, DOI 10.1016/0016-7185(92)90050-E##Rees, 1996, OUR ECOLOGICAL FOOTP##Saul J.

It argues that the superficial consensus that has characterized much of the early debate has given way to a series of parallel but distinct discourses around sustainability. The underlying assumptions behind much of the discussion are assessed, as is the move, after the first Earth Summit (1992), to focus on rights, rather than needs, as the principal line of enquiry. This analytical attention to rights is linked to the neo-liberal economic agendas of the 1990s, and the growth of interest in congruent areas, including human security and the environment, social capital, critical natural capital and intellectual property rights. The paper argues that increasing attention to questions of biology and science studies has strengthened this 'rights-based' approach, as well as interest in the linkages between 'natural' and 'human' systems, including attention to questions of environmental justice. It is clear that issues of global environmental justice are as important as they were when the concept of 'sustainable development' was in its infancy, but the new material realities of science and the environment in the 21st century demand a re-engagement with their social consequences, something which is largely ignored by the (market) liberal consensus.

The spectre of the participating problem-oriented sciences must widen with the increasing complexity of interpretation of sustainable development while the intensity and their co-operation and aggregation must also increase. The ever increasing complexity of global problems and the efforts of science to respond leads to the state when the development of the sustainable development concept including the issue of indicators used for quantification, assessment and communication of this development acquires the metascientific nature. It is a challenge for integrated landscape, society and environmental sciences with geography, landscape ecology, human ecology and environmental science standing in the foreground. Constitution of learning/science about sustainable development of the society and the environment dealing with its metascientific, theoretical-methodical, empirical and applied aspects may represent an important progress in improvement of the not sufficiently satisfying relationship between the science and the concept of sustainable development. On the one side, establishing of such scientific discipline is determined by the proper attributes of the science in general and nature i.e. its inner content and structure of the sustainable development concept on the other.","ECOLOGY","sustainable development; science about sustainable development/sustainability science; research of sustainable development","EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA","Zigrai, F##Huba, M","Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Architecture, Inst Spatial Planning & Urban Design, Bratislava 81245, Slovakia.

An index system of sustainable development is constructed, consisting of five supporting systems: (1) agricultural resources, (2) agricultural development, (3) environment and ecosystem, (4) rural society, and (5) science, education and management. Included in the five supporting systems are 95 factors that are selected at the provincial level as basic indices. A method of assessing relative assets/debts is then used to calculate the net assets (i.e. relative advantage) for each provincial unit. This is done for both the five supporting systems and their total capability. The assessment results are then ranked, and the geographical patterns mapped. Based on the above assessment results, the whole country is divided into nine agricultural development regions (first-level), and 22 sub-regions (second-level). The first-level zones reflect each region's direction for future sustainable agricultural development and management. The second-level zones reflect their level of development, and whether or not each sub-region has reached the basic criteria of sustainable agricultural development. A zoning at provincial level for sustainable agricultural development in China is, thereby, established. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It targeted the movement's traditional focus on human rights, equity, democracy and fair, decent and sustainable employment. The international union discourse on sustainable development that preceded the WSSID (2002) indicated that unions see themselves as part of a social movement towards deliberative democracy focused on sustainable development. The paper draws upon an evolving research relationship between academics and the union movement in New Zealand. The inquiry examines conceptions of sustainable development held by union members; how the concept relates to the workplace in New Zealand; what function it may play in 'union renewal' and the potential role of unions in promoting sustainable development in the workplace and broader community.

Despite the institutionalisation of sustainability principles through legislation and policy around the world, progress in implementing sustainable development actions has been slow. The very open-ended definition of sustainable development provided in these documents, and the ""language"" used has made interpretation of what is required for implementation controversial. ''Principles"" of sustainable development have been developed to provide further guidance for implementation, but sustainability remains a contested and value-laden concept. Yet there is increasing recognition that the present development paths around the world are clearly not sustainable into the future and that we need urgently to address this unsustainability. Water use has become a prominent issue through broad acceptance that its use in many situations, including southeast Australia and cities such as Sydney, is unsustainable.

How funding agencies frame science for sustainable development","This article explores how research funding agencies have responded to the challenge of operationalising the policy agenda of sustainable development. Drawing on the results of a research project studying Swedish funding agencies' policy declarations, mandates and priorities as well as abstracts from funded projects, we analyse how the research domains of sustainable development are defined as well as what type of research projects they support. The article discusses consequences for the internationally emerging field of science for sustainable development. We conclude that even though economic and social aspects have been increasingly recognised, agencies predominantly emphasise the environmental dimension of sustainable development. The agencies characterise environmental research in terms of basic research and sustainable development research as applied. As a consequence, sustainable development research has become heavily oriented towards implementing the dominant political agenda. Such short-term political utility is interpreted by the funding agencies as applied research. A worrying consequence is that many fundamental questions posed within the area of sustainable development receive little or no attention in the funding agencies' priorities. Such neglected research domains include those that posit alternative framings, identify potential problems and reflect on implications of current sustainable development policy.

Under this initiative, it was intended to articulate a vision for the country's development and use this as the basis for identifying a set of development imperatives through a process that will superimpose identified national development goals and targets on the international sustainable development agenda to arrive at a national strategy and plan for sustainable development. The plan also called for institutional and structural adjustments to move the country away from current sectoral-based development planning to an environment of dialogue, cooperation and collaboration among development partners in the articulation of development policies, plans and projects.

A country's national strategy should be designed to help mainstream environmental concerns into policy. More broadly, it should coordinate local policy with global concerns, as well as integrate scientific knowledge into policy and development planning. The peer review mechanism for national strategies was piloted by France, and also involved representatives of countries from the North and the South as well as stakeholders. The peer review process allows countries to share their experience and information, and can assist them in identifying their own path to sustainable development. The business community can also contribute to sustainable development through provision of local and global public goods. Another input to sustainable development could come from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and its Guidance Standard on Social Responsibility (ISO 26000), as a coordinating mechanism between voluntary initiatives and binding obligations (such as international conventions).

It is becoming clearer that technological innovation can be a useful tool for achieving sustainable development. That is, if the technologist is aware of the boundaries that should be considered when working in a sustainable way; and is knowledgeable about how to use the tools that can be used to work in a sustainable way. Therefore, making technology students aware of these boundaries and tools is an important educational task for universities. Such education should, in our view, include two subjects. (1) Giving them insight into the concepts of sustainable development. What is sustainable development? What are sustainability problems? What are the causes of these problems? Which strategies and approaches for solving them are available? (2) Giving them insight into the technology development process. How does the technology development process work? Which factors influence and steer it? What is the influence of technology on society and on sustainable development? The Technology Assessment group at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has developed several courses on the combination of these two subjects, integrating research results in the fields of sustainable development and technology dynamics.

The meteoric rise to prominence of ESD is first briefly reviewed, as is the firm ground it now stands upon as an international and national educational priority. The remainder of the paper explores the shaky ground of ESD: the field's reliance on a goal, sustainable development, which, in its by-and-large continued embrace of the growth principle, is a myopic response to the Earth condition; the field's embrace of an instrumentalist conception of nature when such a conception itself feeds unsustainability; the overly skills/training orientation of ESD and its stunted engagement with a range of key aspects of the human-nature relationship; the failure of ESD to realize its original breadth and promise in its marginalization of the voice of peace, social justice, anti-discriminatory, indigenous and futures educators as well as that of sustainability educators in the South; its adoption of an anachronistic 'steady state' conception of nature.

"J","WOS:000238675800007",2006,"Sustainable development and its implications for chemical engineering","Sustainable development presents us all with the challenge of living in ways which are compatible with the long-term constraints imposed by the finite carrying capacity of the closed system which is Planet Earth. The chemical engineering approach to the management of complex systems involving material and energy flows will be essential in meeting the challenge. System-based tools for environmental management already embody chemical engineering principles, albeit applied to broader systems than those which chemical engineering conventionally covers. Clean technology is an approach to process selection, design and operation which combines conventional chemical engineering with some of these system-based environmental management tools; it represents an interesting new direction in the application of chemical engineering to develop more sustainable processes. Less conventional applications of chemical engineering lie in public sector decisions, using the approach known as post-normal science. These applications require chemical engineers to take on a significantly different role, using their professional expertise to work with people from other disciplines and with the lay public. The contribution of chemical engineering to the formation of UK energy policy provides an example of the importance of this role. Recognising the role of engineers as agents of social change implies the need for a different set of skills, which just might make the profession more attractive to potential new recruits.

However, this research has concentrated more on national and regional levels than on local levels, more on spatial comparisons than on time series analysis, more on short-term than on long-time analysis, more on qualitative than on quantitative analysis. In contrast, therefore, this paper presents an indicator system procedure for measuring Beijing (the capital of China) environmental sustainability based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) philosophy, evaluates the trend of Beijing environmental sustainability index (BESI) quantitatively for 21 years, from 1983 to 2003, and suggests three great opportunities in the near future that are expected to provide some dependable information to policy makers. The results suggest that Beijing is still far from environmental sustainable development. The total trend was better in the 1980s than in the 1990s, and has improved slightly since 2000.","INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM","environment; sustainable development; indicator; assessment; Beijing","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Zhou, WH##Wang, RS##Zhang, KF","Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Key Lab Syst Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.

After briefly describing ten approaches to modelling sustainable development, some of the methodological problems still to be resolved are addressed. It is then suggested that policies to promote sustainable development should operate at six different spatial levels connecting global, multinational, national, regional, local and individual. Attempting to model Sustainable development in such a hierarchical manner is exceedingly difficult. One way of modelling sustainable development is to develop the concept of a sustainable corridor, combining ecological, economic and equity considerations in a hierarchical fashion and through space-time. A preliminary dynamic, hierarchical model is described connecting global and national patterns of development. Using global and national data for Scotland, the calibrated model, running under the business-as-usual scenario, shows that current development paths are unsustainable. It is shown that, by implementing a judicious choice of policies, a sustainable corridor for a global and a national system can be achieved. The ways in which this preliminary model can be developed to connect all six hierarchical levels are discussed.",NA,"sustainable development; sustainable corridors; dynamic; hierarchical modelling","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Moffatt, I","Univ Stirling, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Atkinson AB, 1983, EC INEQUALITY##Atkinson G.D., 1993, ECOL ECON, V8, P103, DOI [DOI 10.1016/0921-8009(93)90039-9, 10.1016/0921-8009(93)90039-9]##BARTOSZCZUK P, 2004, SYST DYN M OXF U OXF##Beck U, 1994, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI##BECKERMAN W, 1995, SMALL IS STUPID BLOW##BRYDENSHOLT HH, 2003, DECISION REGARDING C##Costanza R, 2000, CONSERV ECOL, V4##Costanza R, 1997, NATURE, V387, P253, DOI 10.1038/387253a0##Daly H.

"J","WOS:000242033900025",2006,"Green energy strategies for sustainable development","In this study we propose some green energy strategies for sustainable development. In this regard, seven green energy strategies are taken into consideration to determine the sectoral, technological, and application impact ratios. Based on these ratios, we derive a new parameter as the green energy impact ratio. In addition, the green energy-based sustainability ratio is obtained by depending upon the green energy impact ratio, and the green energy utilization ratio that is calculated using actual energy data taken from literature. In order to verify these parameters, three cases are considered. Consequently, it can be considered that the sectoral impact ratio is more important and should be kept constant as much as possible in a green energy policy implementation. Moreover, the green energy-based sustainability ratio increases with an increase of technological, sectoral, and application impact ratios. This means that all negative effects on the industrial, technological, sectoral and social developments partially and/or completely decrease throughout the transition and utilization to and of green energy and technologies when possible sustainable energy strategies are preferred and applied. Thus., the sustainable energy strategies can make an important contribution to the economies of the countries where green energy (e.g., wind, solar, tidal, biomass) is abundantly produced. Therefore, the investment in green energy supply and progress should be encouraged by governments and other authorities for a green energy replacement of fossil fuels for more environmentally benign and sustainable future.

The Conference focused on sustainability but one panel focused on practical applications for public policy and private industry. The papers from this panel are presented in this special issue of the journal. They cover topics ranging from corporate sustainable programs to government plans including ""feed in laws"". Some papers are more academic oriented but clearly derived from practical political experiences such as those of the California energy crisis. These theories argue the need for ""agile energy systems"" whereby regions, cities and communities must have combinations of on-site or distributed energy generation like combined heat and power (CPH) along with central grid power generation. Finally, there is a clear message in all the papers that ""market forces"" alone do not develop, monitor or even provide ""level playing fields"" for communities. In short, there needs to be continuous ""government"" or public involvement in the sustainable communities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a variety of initiatives have been undertaken, many organizations have struggled with the implementation of the concept in practice. This paper addresses this issue by providing a framework for the integration of sustainable development into mainstream business systems. The proposed integrated management systems (IMS) model illustrates how existing management systems for quality, environment, occupational health and safety, and corporate social responsibility may be enhanced so that they are more reflective of sustainable development. Integration is considered from both a macro-level and a micro-level perspective. The macro-level perspective emphasizes a systems approach to viewing the IMS while the micro-level perspective considers integration on the basis of the model's seven elements. The paper highlights that sustainable development cannot be viewed as a disconnected initiative and implementation requires integration with existing business infrastructure.",NA,"sustainable development; integrated management systems","TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE","Rocha, M##Searcy, C##Karapetrovic, S","ITESM, Div Engn & Technol Linkage, Torreon, Mexico.

As a corporate citizen, Shell has contributed in various ways to local community development in the area. Based on a critical analysis of the changes in its strategies and policies, the paper contends that Shell's previous approaches to community development in the Niger Delta encouraged unsustainable development and a culture of dependency. It concludes that the recently launched sustainable community development strategy has the potential to succeed where others failed, if it is implemented within a tri-sector partnership framework involving Shell, the Nigerian government and civil society.

We start by constructing ideal types of interpretation of sustainable development (weak and strong) and rationality (value rationality and instrumental rationality) as conceptual and theoretical 'tools' for our further analysis. We then discuss the role of and analyze the construction of rationality and legitimation in the sustainable development discourse. We explore the ways in which rationality and legitimation are constructed to support one's own interpretation, and, on the other hand, how the rationality and legitimacy of the opposing interpretations are nullified. We then discuss the basis of prudent decision-making, and the possibilities and problems that are bound up in the concept of sustainable development. The paper concludes by stating that when it comes to sustainable development neither societal decision-making nor the actions based on it is currently prudent.

It is important, therefore, to question the effectiveness of SDIs in an effort to continue advancing sustainability. This paper addresses one aspect of this question by exploring whether our global SDI metrics are sending a clear message to guide us towards sustainable development. Six global SDI metrics are compared by relative ranking in colour coded tabular format and spatially in map format. The combined presentation of results clearly illustrates that the different inetrics arrive at varying interpretations about the sustainability of nations. The degree of variability between the metrics is analyzed using Correlation analysis. The variability in findings draws attention to the lack of a clear direction at the global level in how best to approach sustainable development. Canada is presented as a case study to highlight and explain the discrepancies between SDI measures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Countries striving to this end are seeking to reassess their energy systems with a view toward planning energy programmes and strategies in line with sustainable development goals and objectives. This paper summarizes the outcome of an international partnership initiative on indicators for sustainable energy development that aims to provide an analytical tool for assessing current energy production and use patterns at a national level. The proposed set of energy indicators represents a first step of a consensus reached on this subject by five international agencies-two from the United Nations system (the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the International Atomic Energy Agency), two from the European Union (Eurostat and the European Environment Agency) and one from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the International Energy Agency). Energy and environmental experts including statisticians, analysts, policy makers and academics have started to implement general guidelines and methodologies in the development of national energy indicators for use in their efforts to monitor the effects of energy policies on the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000246592000015",2007,"Frontiers and sustainable economic development","Exploiting new resource ""frontiers,"" such as agricultural land and mineral reserves, is a fundamental feature of economic development in poor economies. Yet frontier-based development is symptomatic of a pattern of economy-wide resource exploitation in developing economies that: (a) generates little additional economic rents, and (b) what rents are generated are not being reinvested in other sectors. Such development is inherently unsustainable. The following paper explains this phenomenon, and provides evidence that long-run expansion of agricultural land and oil and natural gas proved reserves across poor economies is associated with lower levels of real income per capita. The paper proposes a frontier expansion hypothesis to explain why the structural economic dependence of these economies on frontier land expansion and resource exploitation is not conducive to sustained long-run growth. The key to sustainable economic development in poor economies will be improving the economic integration between frontier and other sectors of the economy, targeting policies to improved resource management in frontier areas and overcoming problems of corruption and rent-seeking in resource sectors.","PANEL-DATA; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; NATURAL-RESOURCES; GROWTH; CURSE; LAND; INSTITUTIONS; PROPERTY; ORIGINS; MODEL","economic development; frontier; natural capital; natural resources; resource-abundant economies; sustainable development","ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS","Barbier, EB","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Dept 3985, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.","Economics; Environmental Studies","Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ALSTON LJ, 1999, TITLES CONFLICT LAND, P25##Ascher W., 1999, WHY GOVT WASTE NATUR##Baland Jean-Marie, 1996, HALTING DEGRADATION##Baltagi B.H., 2001, ECONOMETRIC ANAL PAN##BALTAGI BH, 1990, J APPL ECONOM, V5, P401, DOI 10.1002/jae.3950050408##Barbier E.

Using a system dynamics approach and relying on the concept of viability loops, the paper aims to illustrate a practical implementation of sustainable development with an urban water system as an example. It argues that planning for sustainable development should be 'process-based' - rather than 'fixed-goal'-oriented. Unlike the traditional approaches of strategy making to set fixed goals related to either supply-side and/or demand-side management, it is argued that triggering a social learning process with full involvement of all stakeholders and planners in the process would be the most suitable strategy for sustainable development. To this end, backcasting is recommended as a suitable tool and the process of model building is regarded as a means of learning rather than forecasting.

"J","WOS:000246671100003",2007,"Story telling in sustainable development projects","This paper constitutes an attempt to find a means to represent multiple stories in the strong narrative of conventional sustainable development (SD) projects. The authors' experience of such projects in various parts of the world indicates that they have a tendency to arise from and reflect a dominant mindset, placing the SD project in what can be a working environment that is inimical to the very ideals that SD is supposed to represent. Short-termism and value for money drive project formats and objectives, whilst counter-narratives and alternative stories arising from stakeholders in such projects are often ignored. Yet these alternative threads often contain strong SD messages of their own and could, if effectively utilized, enhance the SD project process. This paper sets out the case for a new field - 'project ethnography' - allied with the growing use of meta-analysis to compare project 'stories'. The analytical model applied to compare projects is based on the Kolb learning cycle and involves a (3 X 4)-fold questioning of project conceptual ization and roll-out.

The study of intragenerational equity is less common. In this article, I am interested in a particular kind of intragenerational equity, territorial equity. As well as exposing the various territorial inequalities, the literature on SD comprehends territorial equity through possible territorial transfers of sustainability. The reality of these transfers and how to measure them are however, very directly dependent on general conceptions of SD. The text examines analyses that may be inferred from these different ideas.

The focus of the sustainable development concept is humankind. Humankind has the responsibility of protecting the environment it lives in, as much as it has the right to continue living a healthy productive life in harmony with nature. These responsibilities will be the main elements in determining continuity. With these aspects in mind, the research deals with the basic criteria predicted by Meadows on sustainable development. These criteria are divided into three: 'sustainable', 'critical' and 'destructive'. The first element evaluated in these predicted criteria is the increase in population. From the pace of the population increase observed in Turkey, it can be said that Turkey affects the sustainable development in a 'destructive' way. Other criteria, such as economic development, deforestation rate, the area of the forests and the density of the population show an inclination towards the 'critical area'. Turkey, in terms of its agricultural development, self-sufficiency rate and urban population, is to be found in the sustainable development range.

Such efforts can increase local social capital and thus the ability to address sustainable development issues, they can serve as educational examples that increase general knowledge of alternative development models and they can inspire similar efforts in other places.

This paper presents a summary of the two fields, Space Tourism and Sustainable Development, and explores links between the two at five levels; operations, cultural, economic, resources and human survival.

"J","WOS:000250932400004",2007,"The contribution of corporate social responsibility to sustainable development","This paper considers the motivations for and nature of business contributions to sustainable development though the medium of corporate social responsibility (CSR). It compares CSR with sustainable development, given that they are both 'essentially contested concepts'; it introduces CSR's changing meaning and it explains why there has been a recent increase in CSR with reference to the increasing socialization of markets as a result of narrow market drivers, along with other social, governmental and globalization drivers. It uses Hart's 'A natural-resource-based view of the firm' to explain the way in which these drivers give rise to sustainable development agendas in companies and provides illustration of these. The concluding discussion identifies some limitations to CSR as a vehicle for sustainable development and signals important avenues of research for policy-makers.

Non convex dynamics imply existence of resilience, that is the robustness of systems to withstand exogenous perturbations. Resilience can be regarded as an insurance against flips of the system into different basins of stability. Sustainable development, according to the Bruntland report, is the provision of productive resources to future generations to make it possible for them to live as well as the present generation. Thus, the value of changes in productive assets is therefore an index of whether an economy is on a sustainable path or not. Resilience can be regarded as one such productive asset and the paper discusses how one can define the value of this asset.",NA,"sustainable development; wealth; accounting prices; non convex dynamics; resilience","ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS","Maler, KG","Ropyal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.","Economics; Environmental Studies","Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ANIYAR S, 2006, IN PRESS INCLUSIVE W##Arrow K, 2004, J ECON PERSPECT, V18, P147, DOI 10.1257/0895330042162377##Arrow KJ, 2003, ECON THEOR, V21, P217, DOI 10.1007/s00199-002-0335-2##Asheim GB, 2001, ECON LETT, V73, P233, DOI 10.1016/S0165-1765(01)00493-1##Daily G.C., NATURES SERVICES SOC##Dasgupta P., 2003, EC NONCONVEX ECOSYST##DASGUPTA P, 2000, ENVIRON DEV ECON, V5, P69##*EC HUM WELLB, 2005, MILL EC ASS##KOOPMANS TC, 1960, ECONOMETRICA, V28, P287, DOI 10.2307/1907722##KOOPMANS TC, 1964, ECONOMETRICA, V32, P1##MALER KG, 2006, PRICING RESLIENCE DY##Steffen W., 2003, GLOBAL CHANGE EARTH##TZOUVELEKAS E, 2006, BEIJER DISCUSSION PA, V206##WEITZMAN M, 2006, Q J ECON, V90, P152##Xepapadeas A., 2005, HDB ENV EC, V3##2003, INTEGRATED ENV EC AC",46,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM16","no","SDG.15#SDG.8"

The analysis was made with, as a starting point, energy indicators for sustainable development, which take into account social, economic and environmental aspects. The study demonstrates that the country has great availability of energy resources and that renewable sources can contribute to maintain a big participation in the production and use of energy, giving the country considerable advantages in economic and environmental terms. As regards the social aspect, on the other hand, the unequal distribution of income continues to be the country's principal weak point in achieving sustainable development. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Since then, international organizations have begun to apply this framework to the evaluation of sustainable development initiatives, to better understand and overcome barriers to sustainability. While this may seem a logical application for an integrated environmental assessment tool, the use of DPSIR in sustainable development will likely perpetuate the least satisfactory outcomes of development. DPSIR cannot address the impact of aggregated, informal responses on the drivers and pressures related to environmental problems and sustainability challenges. This problem is not merely an oversight of the framework, but an issue that emerges within the structure of DPSIR itself through the unexamined, unacknowledged hierarchy of actors that this framework implicitly creates with its typology. Therefore, a DPSIR-centered approach is not a new direction for development within international organizations, but instead, a reproduction of existing inequalities between actors and stakeholders within current approaches.","WOMEN; AGRICULTURE; GENDER; FRAMEWORK; STATE; ENVIRONMENT; TRANSITION; INDICATORS; KNOWLEDGE; FARMERS","DPSIR; actors; stakeholders; sustainable development","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Carr, ER##Wingard, PM##Yorty, SC##Thompson, MC##Jensen, NK##Roberson, J","[Carr, Edward R.; Wingard, Philip M.; Yorty, Sara C.; Thompson, Maiy C.; Jensen, Natalie K.; Roberson, Justin] Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Barrientos S, 2005, IDS BULL-I DEV STUD, V36, P74, DOI 10.1111/j.1759-5436.2005.tb00200.x##Barry H, 2002, CROSS-CULT RES, V36, P286, DOI 10.1177/10697102036003005##Bassett T.

"J","WOS:000252763900003",2007,"Sustainable development and leadership","The available empirical evidence suggests that contemporary globalisation is unsustainable in the long run unless we introduce new institutions and new applied policies which will deal with this global problem. The social order in which ""profit above all else"" rules cannot be an efficient regulator of the balance between material growth and the natural resources of life. Thus a new direction of development is needed which will not repeat the mistakes of the old one. This new direction offers the concept of sustainable development which presupposes a considerable amount of social change and which has the character of a global societal social innovation. The two main pillars of sustainable development are ""learning for sustainability"" and ""leading change towards sustainability"". This article is dedicated to ""leading towards sustainability"" as a conscious and planned activity of democratically chosen political elites and other decision-making actors regarding the direction and modes of modern development. Leadership is by no means the dictatorship of the individual or cliques, a monopoly, or a type of ""eco-fascism"". In the article, the author considers the question of why sustainable development cannot be spontaneous, and why it has to be purposefully managed. Efficient leadership presupposes that the social actors of leading change towards sustainability have to internalise sustainability, life preservation and survival as the ultimate value and their special interest, and have to systematically ""feed themselves with new knowledge"". The production of social actors for leadership towards sustainability, a kind of ""production of actors of sustainable future"" is the most important task of modern education systems throughout the world.",NA,"sustainable development; leadership towards sustainability","DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA","Lay, V",NA,"Social Issues; Sociology","Social Issues; Sociology","AYERS E, 2000, LAST GOD OFFER NEGOT##Borghesi S, 2003, ECOL ECON, V44, P77, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00222-7##BRYSON B, 2006, WEATHER MAKERS HIST##Lay V, 2005, DRUS ISTRAZ, V14, P353##LAY V, 2007, VIZIJA ODRZIVOG RAZV##LAY V, 2007, KAP PREKO RUBA CASE##Lay V., 1992, SOCIJALNA EKOLOGIJA, V1, P1##LAY V, 2007, RAZVOJ SPOSOBAN BUDU##Linden E., 2006, WINDS CHANGE CLIMATE##Lux K, 2003, ECOL ECON, V44, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00270-7##MASON C, 2006, SHORT HIST FUTURE SU##Radermacher Franz Josef, 2003, RAVNOTEZA ILI RAZARA##SACHS J, 2007, KRAJ SIROMASTVA EKON",2,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM4","no","SDG.12#SDG.9"

Progress in both these dimensions of sustainable development can be assessed: we use the UN Human Development Index (HDI) as an indicator of development and the Ecological Footprint as an indicator of human demand on the biosphere. We argue that an HDI of no less than 0.8 and a per capita Ecological Footprint less than the globally available biocapacity per person represent minimum requirements for sustainable development that is globally replicable. Despite growing global adoption of sustainable development as an explicit policy goal, we find that in the year 2003 only one of the 93 countries surveyed met both of these minimum requirements. We also find an overall trend in high-income countries over the past twenty five years that improvements to HDI come with disproportionately larger increases in Ecological Footprint, showing a movement away from sustainability. Some lower-income countries, however, have achieved higher levels of development without a corresponding increase in per capita demand on ecosystem resources. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The final objective was to construct a conceptual and operational model of SRD which could be evaluated using interactive approximations. This proposal is based on the democratic participation of targeted communities and management of their environment to achieve balanced and sustainable development. Environmental management thus combines the objectives of political and economic democracy with social and cultural ones through a process of economic and political decentralization. It is guided by principles of ecological organization surrounding production activities, ethnic and biological diversity in the environment, and productive self-management of the communities. The proposed concept of SRD, being a mental abstraction and a time involved process with different socio-economic and environmental contexts, cannot be constructed as a general statement.

One such vision is provided by the sustainable development concept, though this is understood in different ways. The conceptualizations of sustainable development within the worlds of politics and business still lie within the framework of the earlier paradigm of civilizational development. At the same time, the possibility of development being understood in a quite separate way is taking shape, and this may represent a starting point for a new vision of social development. The latter will necessitate a fundamental and far-reaching rethinking and revision of the philosophical (above all the anthropological and axiological), economic and political underpinnings of any further development, as well as an incorporation of sustainable development content into every sphere and aspect of humanity's cultural evolution.

"J","WOS:000255093400004",2008,"Ecophilosophy as a philosophical underpinning of sustainable development","The subjects considered here underpin the philosophical way in which the sustainable development concept is justified. In this context, the new branch of philosophy known as ecophilosophy is seen to have left behind the special pleading on behalf of humankind's exploitative attitudes towards Nature, in favour of considerations that - as they assign value to the biosphere per se - aim at the harmonious coexistence of the human species with all beings present in the biosphere. In the conceptual terms with which ecophilosophy has armed itself, sustainable development is the search for proper moderation in so far as human activity in the environment is concerned. A strategy for sustainable development is a mechanism needing to be incorporated into any further advancement of Western civilization.

One solution may be the idea of 'sustainable development', which presents a series of solutions leading to the protection and safeguarding of three thrusts to development, i.e. that of society (culture), of nature and of the economy. It assumes major modifications to our way of thinking - and to the means of civilizational development - pursued hitherto. It points to the need for the spiritual development of humankind, and for an exchange of the goals of development from the material centred to the non-materialistic. With respect to these general assumptions and goals, sustainable development encounters many practical and psychological problems that curb (or even prevent) the effective incorporation of the concept in practice (the greatest single barrier is global unilateralism).

An application of this concept to landscape, as a product and a field of interaction of human and natural processes, is possible and necessary. It is evident that concepts of landscape and cultural heritage are closely interrelated: cultural heritage can obviously exist in a landscape and influence it as well as landscape can be treated as cultural heritage. The interrelationship between these concepts makes possible the search for links between cultural heritage and sustainable development of landscape. Built heritage, the abundant category of cultural heritage encompassing historic buildings, their ensembles, and other structures, has an indisputable influence on landscapes and is crucial for their sustainable development.

In this article, we introduce the Finnish experience on producing and disseminating sustainable development indicators. We describe four indicator initiatives prepared and published during the last decade and discuss the role of different conceptual frameworks for preparing and presenting the indicators. The requirements for a good conceptual framework are reviewed and the effectiveness of different frameworks for different purposes is discussed based on the cases presented. We conclude by stressing the importance of paying more attention to indicator set frameworks instead of individual indicators and using specifically tailored frameworks for specific uses.

"J","WOS:000260504600005",2008,"Post-Sustainable Development","The past 15 years have witnessed the rise of post-development theory as a means of understanding the development discourse since the 1940s. Post-development argues that intentional development (as distinct from immanent development - what people are doing anyway) is a construct of Western hegemony. Sustainable development, they argue, is no different and indeed is perhaps worse, given that most of the global environmental degradation has been driven by consumerism and industrialization in the West. Critics of post-development counter by stating that it only provides destruction by tearing apart what is currently practiced in 'development' without providing an alternative. When post-developmentalists do offer an alternative it typically amouints to little more than a call for more grassroots involvement in development and disengagement from a Western agenda. Post-sustainable development analysis and counter-analysis has received remarkably little attention within the sustainable development literature, yet this paper argues that it can make a positive contributrion by calling for an analysis of discourse rather than a hiding of power differentials and an assumption that consensus must exist within a community. A case is made for a post-sustainable development that acknowledges that diversity will exist and consensus may not be achievable, but at the same time participation can help with learning. The role of the expert within sustainable development is also discussed.

In 2002, Brazil approved its Agenda 21. It was prepared through a participative process, a significant experience in a scenario of great social, environmental, and economic diversity, although the Brazilian government does not have yet a consolidated monitoring and assessing system tailored to its National Agenda 21. Following the United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development guiding and support, the IBGE - Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute - published in 2002 the document IDS - Sustainable Development Indicators, Brazil 2002. Even though both efforts have been carried out simultaneously, and have had the same focus - Brazilian sustainable development -, the non-integration of both processes has produced gaps within the set of indicators, weakening the opportunity of creating conditions for assessment and revision of the national sustainable development plan and the several local agendas 21. This is the focus of this document, as it presents an integrated analysis of Brazilian Agenda 21 preparation, understood as a National Strategic Plan for Brazilian Sustainable Development, and of the construction of Brazil's Sustainable Development Indicators as proposed by IBGE, presenting positive aspects, advances, opportunities, gaps, and perspectives.",NA,"Indicator; Sustainable Development; Agenda 21; Environmental Management","SAUDE E SOCIEDADE","Malheiros, TF##Phlippi, A##Coutinho, SMV","[Malheiros, Tadeu Fabricio] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Engn Sao Carlos, Projeto Siades Sistema Informacoes Ambientais Par, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.

This article describes the scientific foundation and architecture of this program. TransForum operates on the basis of five working hypotheses which together constitute one integrated analytical framework. These hypotheses are: (1) sustainable development is a dynamic system property; (2) sustainable development needs system innovation; (3) system innovation is a non-linear learning process; (4) system innovation requires active participation of relevant key players from knowledge institutes, governmental bodies, civil society organisations and the business community; (5) the program requires transdisciplinary collaboration of all players. TransForum identifies three new innovation strategies: (1) vital clusters; (2) regional development; (3) international agro-food networks; as alternatives to the current arrangements. Innovative projects are organised in these innovation strategies. The aim of the scientific program is threefold: (1) it addresses research questions raised in the innovative projects; (2) it investigates the need for system-innovations and the way in which they can be realized; (3) it designs research projects to test the 5 main working hypotheses of the program. The scientific program is organised in four themes following a cyclic innovation process which is constantly monitored. The cycle starts with people's preferences and images, followed by studies on which inventions are required to achieve a successful innovation. Subsequently, it is investigated how to organize new innovations and transitions and finally, how citizen/consumers behaviour and preferences mobilizes sustainable development, closing the loop.","LAND-USE","sustainable development; transition; system innovation; networks","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Veldkamp, A##Van Altvorst, AC##Eweg, R##Jacobsen, E##Van Kleef, A##Van Latesteijn, H##Mager, S##Mommaas, H##Smeets, PJAM##Spaans, L##Van Trijp, JCM","[Veldkamp, A.; Van Altvorst, A.

"J","WOS:000262453100006",2008,"Governance for Sustainable Development: A Framework","This paper explores how two complex concepts, governance and sustainable development, can be linked in order to obtain a better understanding of their interactions. We argue that the many perspectives on sustainable development can be mapped on the continuum between ecological sustainability and quality of life. Likewise, the variety of modes of governance can be captured between hierarchical governance and deliberative governance, depending on the degree of involvement of societal actors. From these two typologies we derive a framework for analysis of governance for sustainable development. We realize that the typology is a significant simplification of the complex debates about sustainable development and governance, but it might help scientists and policy makers to explore relevant dimensions of modes of governance for sustainable development and for setting a framework for empirical analysis. The main conclusion of this paper is that the debate on governance for sustainable development will be clarified if the perspective on sustainable development and the mode of governance for achieving it are made more explicit. Problems that are now exclusively associated with sustainable development might well be problems of governance for sustainable development. Without making explicit what type of governance for sustainable development is pursued, miscommunication between stakeholders and mismatches of the approach with the instruments used could be the result, thus hampering progress in implementing sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000262861100002",2009,"Thermodynamic Aspects of Renewable and Sustainable Development","Exergy analysis enables one to evaluate quantitatively the causes resulting in increases of exergy due to thermodynamic imperfections of thermal and chemical processes. Exergy express the quality of energy and can be defined as the minimal work necessary to produce a material in its specified state from materials common in the environment in a reversible way, heat being exchanged only with the environment. On the other hand, achieving sustainable solutions to today's energy and environmental problems needs long-term planning and actions. Energy issues are particularly prevalent at present and renewables appear to provide one component of an effective sustainable solution. Discussed in this article are possible future energy-utilization patterns and related environmental impacts, potential solutions to current environmental problems, renewable energy technologies and their relations to sustainable development, and how the principles of thermodynamics via exergy can be beneficially used to evaluate energy systems and technologies as well as environmental impact. Throughout the article, current and future perspectives regarding thermodynamics and sustainable development are considered.","EXERGY ANALYSIS; ENERGY","chemical exergy; renewable energy; sustainable development; thermodynamics","ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS","Kaygusuz, K##Bilgen, S","[Kaygusuz, K.; Bilgen, S.] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Chem, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey.","Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical; Environmental Sciences","Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Bejan A., 1996, THERMAL DESIGN OPTIM##Bilgen S, 2008, ENERG SOURCE PART A, V30, P1267, DOI 10.1080/15567030701258311##Bilgen S, 2004, ENERG SOURCE, V26, P1119, DOI 10.1080/00908310490441421##Bilgen S, 2004, ENERG SOURCE, V26, P1083, DOI 10.1080/00908310490494621##BILGEN S, 2005, ENERG SOURCE, V30, P325##BULUT V, 2005, THESIS KARADENIZ TU##Dincer I, 2005, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V9, P169, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2004.02.002##GHAMARIAN A, 1982, ENERGY, V7, P483, DOI 10.1016/0360-5442(82)90010-X##Gong M, 2001, EXERGY INT J, V1, P217, DOI DOI 10.1016/S1164-0235(01)00030-9##*IEA, 2003, REN POW GEN STAT PRO##JOHANSSON TB, 2002, ENERGY SUSTAINABLE D, P3##Kaygusuz K, 2002, RENEW ENERG, V25, P431, DOI 10.1016/S0960-1481(01)00075-1##Kotas TJ, 1995, EXERGY METHOD THERMA##Moran MJ, 1982, AVAILABILITY ANAL GU##Slanina J, 2004, ENCY ENERGY, P39, DOI [10.1016/B0-12-176480-X/00387-9, DOI 10.1016/B0-12-176480-X/00387-9]##SZARGUT J, 1989, APPL ENERG, V32, P269, DOI 10.1016/0306-2619(89)90016-0##Szargut J, 1988, EXERGY ANAL THERMAL##Wall G, 1986, THESIS CHALMERS U TE",15,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM2","no","SDG.7#SDG.12"

"J","WOS:000264573300008",2009,"Successful globalisation, education and sustainable development","This article examines the role of education in 'successful globalisation' and how this links with agendas for sustainable development. In the first part 'successful globalisation' is defined as economic growth combined with equality and social peace. Japan and the East Asian tiger economies - particularly South Korea and Taiwan - have been uniquely successful in the last half century in achieving both rapid economic growth over long periods and relative income equality and social cohesion. A host of factors have been responsible for this, including fortuitous geo-political circumstances and good timing. However, education has also played a major role. The article, based on a review of international and national research literatures, analyses how far China, India, Kenya and Sri Lanka have managed to develop their own forms of successful engagement with the global economy and what part education policy has played. In the second part we relate our concept of successful globalisation to the parallel discourses of sustainable development and education for sustainable development and reflect on what our notion of 'successful globalisation' can borrow from and lend to these literatures.

"J","WOS:000265860500007",2009,"Sustainable Horticulture and Community Development: More than Just Organic Production","In the age of globalization, sustainability and community development are intimately connected and ultimately challenged. Sustainability is vague and so co-opted as to be almost meaningless, while community development is often reduced to economic development, without any consideration of how this could affect overall sustainability. Amidst such confusion, what does sustainable horticulture mean and how can it contribute to community development? This paper will present a new meaning for sustainability, tying it to the concept of the civil commons. From this baseline of understanding, it will then give fresh meaning to the term sustainable horticulture, allowing it to become a vehicle for the improvement of human and environmental well-being, not a means of making ever-increasing private profits, regardless of the social, environmental, and even economic costs. The organic approach forms a natural alliance with sustainability, blending to produce a form of horticulture that has the potential to be economically constructive, socially responsible, and environmentally sound. Such a sustainable horticulture would contribute to community development in the full sense of the term, not as endless growth for rootless investors but as the unfolding of potential for more than just the lucky few. In our globalized world, four out of every five people have been made poor, the climate has been destabilized, and we experience endless war for control of dwindling resources. Horticulture can either exacerbate these problems or help to solve them. A truly sustainable horticulture would not only be organic, but also produce social, environmental, and economic justice, thus contributing to local community development on a global scale and becoming part of what has been referred to as sustainable globalization.","FAIR-TRADE; COFFEE; AGRICULTURE; MARKETS; ECONOMY","civil commons; globalization; organic horticulture; community development; sustainability; sustainable horticulture","JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE","Sumner, J","[Sumner, Jennifer] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

"J","WOS:000266067100003",2009,"The Concept of Sustainable Development and its Use for Sustainability Scenarios","The problem of conceptual descriptions and evaluation of sustainable development are analyzed in the work. As the objectives, descriptions of the concept of sustainable development are analyzed and classified Then the analysis of the concept of sustainable development is given. After this analysis the systematic view of the dimensions of sustainable development is provided. Methods of systematic scientific literature analysis, general and logical analysis, comparison and generalization were used for the research. Although the essence of the concept of sustainable development is clear enough, the exact interpretation and definition of sustainable development have caused strong discussions. Thus, we should take into consideration the fact that the concept of sustainable development may be difficult to understand and may have different meaning dependending on the analyzed literature on the concept in which it is used. For this reason, in the article we presented several descriptions of sustainable development that would include multiple aspects of this concept. Difficulties related to the definition of sustainability show that sustainable development is a complex and multidimensional issue, which combines efficiency, equity, and intergenerational equity based on economic, social, and environmental aspects. Debates on sustainable development presented in the literature can be classified into several thematic areas: a) conceptual; b) contextual; c) academic; and d) geopolitical, which are investigated in the article in more details. As a general concept, sustainable development encompasses three fundamental approaches: economic, environmental, and social development, which are interrelated and complementary. Traditionally, the concept of sustainable development involves three equivalent components: environmental, economic, and social development; as well as three dimensions of wellbeing, i.e. economic, ecological, and social, and their complex interrelations, which are investigated in article in more details. We tend to think that the analysis of sustainable development should be based on the assumption, indicating that sustainable development is based not on economic, social, ecological, or institutional dimensions, but rather on their system as an integrated whole. Not all relations identified in a sustainability analysis have the same relevance and the same meaning for the strategic instruments of regional sustainable development. Relations among sub-systems identified should be relocated in a logical structure, based on the intention of the cognitive tool being built. In order to attain this, a hierarchical framework with coherent sustainability logic is needed. Since sustainability issues should be analyzed and solved on the system levels where they develop and manifest themselves, one can consistently formulate respective aims of the sustainable development policy for separate dimensions (economic, ecological, social, and institutional) of sustainable development on each of these levels of economic development policy, thus obtaining the matrix of the aims of sustainability policy.","VULNERABILITY; EXPERIENCE","sustainable development; dimensions of sustainability; sustainability policy","INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS","Ciegis, R##Ramanauskiene, J##Martinkus, B","[Ciegis, Remigijus] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.

The resulting SWOT analyses pointed to the progressive adoption of European Union (EU) standards in energy policy and regulation as the most important achievement in the energy sector. The most important problems the national energy sector faces are scarce domestic resources and unfavorable energy mix, low electricity prices, a high degree of inefficiency in energy production and use, as well as insufficient institutional and human capacities. The formulated portfolio of actions towards enabling sustainable energy development urges the adoption of a comprehensive energy strategy built upon sustainability principles, intensified utilization of the natural gas, economic prices of electricity, structural changes in industry, promotion of energy efficiency and renewables, including Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects, enforcement of EU environmental standards and meeting the environmental requirements, as well as institutional and human capacity building.

This paper aims to reconsider what is meant by sustainability and to show that the way accounting operates in an organisation actually prevents an organisation from recognising sustainable operations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops a theoretical argument that sustainability depends upon a redefinition of efficiency and shows the problems with the current descriptions of organisational activity. Findings - The paper shows that efficiency is not demonstrated, through cost cutting but through recognising value-creating activities, and that sustainability cannot be achieved without a consideration of the distribution of the effects of organisational activity. Research limitations/implications - The research shows a different model of sustainability which highlights key aspects that are not normally included; it thereby points the way towards further research possibilities. Practical implications - An understanding of the key aspects of sustainability will help an organisation in its strategic decision making. Originality/value - The paper presents a different approach to managing sustainability and also shows the relationship between corporate sustainability and corporate accounting, an area which is normally excluded from the discourse.","ACCOUNTABILITY","Sustainable development; Process efficiency; Accounting standards; Stakeholder analysis; Organizational change; Distribution","MANAGEMENT DECISION","Aras, G##Crowther, D","[Crowther, David] De Montfort Univ, Leicester Business Sch, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.

"J","WOS:000268645400002",2009,"Is Air Transport an Effective Tool for Sustainable Development?","Several authoritative studies indicate that air transport makes a strong, positive contribution to economic development - a contribution that far outweighs the environmental and social costs of aviation. This article investigates this benign view, analysing the assumptions upon which it is based and arguing that the relationship between air transport and economic benefits may be more complex than is commonly held. In particular, the benefits of air transport services may be highly unevenly distributed, with particular groups benefiting from air transport provision to a far greater extent than others. Hence this article poses the question of whether air transport is an effective tool for sustainable development, or whether it simply reinforces existing patterns of economic interest and political hegemony. Based on analysis of a range of key documents, some criteria are presented that could potentially be used to indicate how air transport may most effectively be used to promote sustainable development.

Both qualitative and quantitative data are employed, from interviews and questionnaires undertaken in Victoria and Calgary, Canada, and San Francisco, USA. Respondents representing the three clusters of the tourism industry, local government and the host environment were examined on their interpretation of 'sustainable tourism', sustainability goals and barriers to achieving sustainable tourism in urban destinations. Results revealed important similarities and differences among key stakeholders, and particularly a lack of appreciation for a triple bottom line approach among the tourism industry respondents.

It explains the concept of sustainable development based on ancient Indian traditional knowledge, through its culture, heritage and orientation towards forest sustain-ability, as a way to address elements within sustainable development. Further, the fundamental principles, the relevance of Vaastu-Purusha-Mandala and the history of Vaastu Shastra are highlighted with discussions on its philosophical and social aspects.

Recently, forces outside the sector - globalisation, the government, the communities themselves - have pressured the mining organisations to become corporate citizens; that is, to take on social responsibilities and work towards sustainable development in their areas. However, this study revealed a gap between policy and practice: social responsibility and real sustainable development do not reach the communities. This article suggests some critical underlying factors that must be dealt with to close this gap: acculturation stress, power relationships, communication and priorities, and identifying who takes responsibility for various facets of development. The article is based on a study of how stakeholders view community development needs. It makes two main recommendations: a process approach to corporate social responsibility and development rather than 'quick fixes', and proper community engagement initiatives.","QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; ACCULTURATION","Community engagement; corporate social responsibility; social development; sustainable development; mining communities","DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA","Cronje, F##Chenga, CS","[Cronje, Freek] North West Univ, Sch Social & Govt Studies, Potchefstroom, South Africa.

Local socio-economic and political conditions have made EE in Indonesia similar to 'ESD' in terms of its topical scope involving various social issues, although whether it should be referred to as ESD remains unclear. In contrast to the existing concerns about ESD, it involves critical views on the prevailing models of (neo-liberal) economic development.

However the distribution of CDM projects has been extremely uneven across countries and regions, and a few technologies and sectors have dominated the early stages of CDM experience. This has caused some to question whether the CDM has fallen short of its potential in contributing to sustainable development. We review the broad patterns of CDM project approvals and evaluate 10 CDM projects according to their sustainability benefits. The difficulty of defining ""sustainable development"" and the process of defining criteria by individual non-Annex 1 governments has meant that sustainable development concerns have been marginalized in some countries. Given these observed limitations, we present possible CDM policy futures, focusing on the main proposals for a post-2012 climate regime. Five options for enhancing the sustainable development benefits in the CDM are discussed, including proactive approaches to favour eligibility of emission reduction projects which ensure such co-benefits.

Thus, highlighting the particularities of the operation of these ecosystems is of considerable importance. This helps to determine the factors and limitations of stability regarding insular ecosystems. All these issues are analysed in this paper. Since they are related to a case study of the Greek insular space, the formulation of a strategic framework for the sustainable and balanced development of the islands is discussed. This strategy is structured by specific priority axes that aim at tackling limitations and expanding the production base, as well as social development. The policies and mechanisms put in place in order to facilitate these priorities are presented too, as well as the necessary supportive and institutional actions.

Thinking in categories of need to improve quality of live, especially in the context of balancedness of its three holistic dimensions (physical/material, psychical and spiritual/affective) is giving us good arguments for the idea of sustainable development itself and means the need of integrated education, which should include different dimensions of quality of life in the aspect of its close connections with widely understood culture. The pillar integrating these areas of education should be clearly formulated axiological attitude, based on giving and shaping """"warm"" values (i.e. good, empathy, effectiveness). The basic transmitter of value systems to different spheres of holistic education is certainly culture, which should - in this role - infiltrate all dimensions and kinds of education.

Science for sustainable development should have specified research fields, where the background are axiological components, empirical verifications, extrapolation using modeling and simulation, evaluation, results' interpretation or verification of strategies and actions.

This paper addresses questions related to how to share between countries the carbon space and/or efforts to stay within it, in the perspective of sustainable development; different allocation mechanisms are reviewed, responding to criteria such as 'responsibility' for climate change,'capability' to engage in abating it, and 'potential' or future contribution. The carbon space remaining at any time will depend on effective mitigation up till that time, and will condense if more stringent maxima are to be set; per capita this space becomes smaller with rising population. Sharing the carbon space in a fair way requires ""convergence"" of currently widely unequal per capita emissions. If the world is to stay within the carbon space consistent with <2 degrees warming, then developed economies-the wealthiest sources of greenhouse gases should quickly and deeply engage in mitigation. Also, substantial mitigation is to take place in developing countries and that this will require substantial support to developing countries ( financially, technologically). Changing development paths can make a major contribution to climate change mitigation; this requires changes in investment, production and consumption patterns. Green New Deals as proposed in the context of a widened response to the current economic crisis could become a first phase of a fundamental transition towards a decarbonised global economy worldwide. Concerns to do with equity as well as sustainability must be incorporated and integrated into coherent transitory strategies.",NA,"Carbon space; Climate change; Sustainable development; Burden sharing; Differentiation","ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS","Opschoor, H","Inst Social Studies, Dept Econ Sustainable Dev, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands.","Economics; Environmental Studies","Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","AGARWAL A, 1998, ATMOSPHERIC RIGHTS P##AGARWAL A, 1991, GLOBALWARMING UNEQUA##Altvater E, 2009, DEV DIALOGUE, V51, P73##Andersson JO, 2001, ECOL ECON, V37, P113, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00272-X##ASHTON J, 2003, KYOTO SERIE IN PRESS##Baer P, 2008, GREENHOUSE DEV RIGHT##Barassi MR, 2008, ENVIRON RESOUR ECON, V40, P121, DOI 10.1007/s10640-007-9144-1##BIERBAUM, 2007, CONFRONTING CLIMATE##BRADLEY R, 2005, NAVIGATING NUMBERS G##*CDP, 2007, E07IIA7 CDP UN DEP E##*CDP, 2009, E08IIA16 CDP UN DEP##DELLINK R, 2008, R0805 IVM PBL##DENELZEN MGJ, 2004, 7280010272004 RIVM##EDENHOFER O, 2009, 520 POSTD I CLIM IMP##Glasbergen Pieter., 2007, PARTNERSHIPS GOVERNA##HADJSADOK T, 1992, ENV EC SUSTAINABLE D, P143##HOHNE N, 2008, 36401003 UNFCCC##IPCC, 2007, SUMM POL SYNTH REP I##KAROUSIS K, 2008, DIFFERENTIATING COUN##MACGREGOR J, 2007, ROOM MOVE ECOLOGICAL##Meinshausen M, 2009, NATURE, V458, P1158, DOI 10.1038/nature08017##Milanovic B, 2005, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V19, P21, DOI 10.1093/wber/lhi003##Ocampo J.

The stakeholder survey findings suggest a wide gap between community expectations of public transport services and the actual service quality provided. This was consistent across all commuter groups.

We have evaluated a collection of international peer-reviewed papers. These contributions have been debated at the conferences of the International Sustainable Development Research Society (ISDRS). Our main research objective here is to consider the often posed question of why the progress made in sustainable development has been so slow and the work implemented so unsuccessful. We argue that one of the main explanations is that the approaches used in sustainable development are reductionist and often lead into problem shifting and problem displacement. To address the problem of reductionism, we propose what we call 'strategic thinking' and its incorporation into sustainable development work in general. To open up this argument, we arrive at the discussion of three central dimensions of strategic thinking and the relevance of these dimensions when addressing reductionism. These dimensions are the strategy content, strategy process and strategy context.

Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy resources that place a big burden on the economy, and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. As would be expected, the rapid expansion of energy production and consumption has brought with it a wide range of environmental issues at the local, regional, and global levels. With respect to global environmental issues, Turkey's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have grown along with its energy consumption. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources.

"J","WOS:000279227100013",2010,"The advancement of a mathematical model of sustainable development","Earth System Analysis was postulated as a theory by Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber in 1998 as a way to characterise the Earth System-the coupled relationship between the environment and humans. Within this theory is the notion of Geocybernetics-management of the Earth System in order to achieve strategies and mechanisms of co-evolution between the environment and humans. This is regarded as the concept and application of sustainable development. However, whilst fundamental definitions in Earth System Analysis are presented for the coupled relationship between the environment and humans, no such definitions exist for sustainable development within the Earth System context. Consequently, this paper presents a mathematical model of sustainable development that provides for the fundamental abstraction of the key concepts and parameters necessary for sustainable development to occur. The model utilises basic mathematics to detail these concepts and parameters, as well as the conditions required for sustainable development to occur. The model presented is, in some regards, a work in progress, and further refinements will be made given the nature of the research performed to this point, i.e. the fundamental mathematical definition of sustainable development and its application. However, the research conducted thus far has made it reasonable to communicate the findings made up to the present point. The paper also provides a brief example of the application of the model to an environmental impact assessment of a metro rail scheme in India, for the purpose of evaluating the level of sustainable development (if appropriate) for the project under consideration.","SYSTEM","Sustainable development; Earth System Analysis; Geocybernetics","SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE","Phillips, J","[Phillips, Jason] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 1RJ, Devon, England.

In this paper, as a case study, a coastal city of China-Yantai was assessed for sustainable development in the period from 1998 to 2007. We used a methodological framework based on 36 indicators and three composite indices from the dimensions of environment, economy and society subsystems. The assessment results indicated that Yantai was almost in the potentially unsustainable development or intermediate sustainable development, except in 1998 and in 2007. Accordingly, the progress of sustainable development was divided into two stages in the light of the relative changes of three subsystems. Some relevant issues, such as natural capital, GPI vs. GDP in sustainable development assessment were discussed. Finally, an uncertainty analysis was also given in the assessment. In conclusion, the sustainable development in Yantai had experienced a shift from environment-based to social-economic-based in the past 10 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This will lead to a new concept of the competitiveness and deeper relationship between sustainable development and competitiveness. The aim of this article is to set out the future research area of competitiveness theory taking into account the development of competitiveness concept and existing research tendencies. On the one hand, for developing the new concept of competitiveness, it is necessary to critically analyse existing studies on competitiveness. Researchers, examining the problems of competitiveness, differently approach the concept of competitiveness, suggesting different definitions, classification, factors, models of competitiveness, and evaluation criteria. Despite all the discussions on competitiveness however, no clear definition or model of competitiveness has yet been developed. On the other hand, globalization, economic dynamism and social progress, sustainability and competitiveness go hand-in-hand. Competitiveness should be underpinned by a broad vision for the economy and society. There is a need of research initiatives to develop the new concept of ""Sustainable competitiveness"" in the context of globalisation, with much of the research focusing on how sustainable development and competitiveness interact. Such additional research will lead to new theoretical models describing the relationships between international globalization, economic growth, sustainable development, wellbeing and competitiveness.","REGIONAL COMPETITIVENESS; ADVANTAGE; NATIONS; FDI","competitiveness; national competitiveness; competitiveness models; factors; indicators; benchmarking; sustainable development; sustainable competitiveness; economic growth","JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT","Balkyte, A##Tvaronaviciene, M","[Balkyte, Audrone] Off Prime Minister Republ Lithuania, Unit Strateg Anal, LT-01103 Vilnius, Lithuania.

So, countries striving to this end are seeking to reassess their energy systems with a view towards planning energy programs and strategies in line with sustainable development goals and objectives. As would be expected, the rapid expansion of energy production and consumption has brought with it a wide range of environmental issues at the local, regional and global levels. Renewable energy technologies of wind, biofuels, solar thermal and photovoltaics are finally showing maturity and the ultimate promise of cost competitiveness. With respect to global environmental issues, Turkey's carbon dioxide emissions have grown along with its energy consumption. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Engineering education in sustainable development has been discussed at many occasions. What questions have been addressed, what answers have been provided, and what are the main remaining topics for research into engineering education in sustainable development? What should engineers learn regarding sustainable development? How to trigger institutional change within engineering schools: top-down or bottom-up? How to trigger cultural change, how to win the hearts and souls of the faculty? Curriculum change: starting new programs or changing existing ones? The contribution of active learning and project based learning? The role of external stakeholders, external cooperation? How to measure sustainable development learning effects? Practice what you preach: how to green the campus, diminish resource consumption and sustainabilise procurement? How to teach normative content in an academic context? The paper, based mainly on the European literature on EESD of the last decade, discusses the answers that were provided and present an agenda for further research in EESD (This paper has mainly a European perspective.

This paper examines the conjuncture of these two trends by assessing the linkage between national culture and corporate sustainable development practices in 55 countries. The results suggest that two of Hofstede's national culture dimensions are linked to a higher degree of sustainable practices by corporations. In particular, a nation's high degree of individualism and uncertainty avoidance were both related to green corporatism, environmental innovation, fair labor practices and corporate social involvement. The results provide managers with another tool in making decisions about offshoring, global sourcing and international production expansion.

Despite being able to motivate change within the market place, overall it is found to be limited in its direct ability to affect social change and lead the development of a more sustainable economy. However, it is found to be a useful form of political participation that encourages engagement and has a role in sending general messages to governments regarding citizens' willingness to take action over important social and environmental issues. These conclusions are based on the finding that consumers' signals and market's reactions to specific campaigns within sustainable development may be inconsistent, unclear or weak. However, overall this market action does send clear messages regarding the broader issues and people's desire to see action upon them.

"J","WOS:000285792300007",2010,"Ecological Modernization Versus Sustainable Development: the Case of Genetic Modification Regulation in New Zealand","Ecological modernization and sustainable development are the two dominant paradigms in environmental policy. This paper assesses the implications of competing understandings of ecological modernization and sustainable development using the case of genetic modification regulation in New Zealand. Although the New Zealand regulatory framework embraces the symbolic language of sustainability, it ultimately adheres to a narrow notion of ecological modernization. By adopting a technically driven risk management process and a diluted precautionary approach, alongside limiting public input into decision-making on genetic modification, it undercuts its commitment to sustainable development definitionally and procedurally. Analysis of the New Zealand biotechnology policy regulatory framework, which consists of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act and the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA), shows how institutionalization of a narrow conception of ecological modernization can preempt real commitment to sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000286782000052",2011,"The effect of natural resources on a sustainable development policy: The approach of non-sustainable externalities","The debate about the importance of non-renewable resources for economic development between optimists and pessimists shows that the extensive depletion of non-renewable resources, particularly oil, along with a higher level of consumption could have a significant impact on the economic development of future generations. Based on this debate, this paper proposes criteria under which the depletion of non-renewable resources would create excess costs for future generations. Therefore, this paper aims to answer the question ""What will be the impact of the depletion of non-renewable resources on sustainable economic development?"" Accordingly, a sustainable development policy appears feasible by minimizing non-sustainable externalities which derive from future externalities that weigh the benefits from a previous employment of natural resources. The research based on qualitative analysis clarifies the reasons for and the extents of taking sustainability into account as well as points to difficulties of implementing policies to time the transition towards a sustainable economic development. Finally, the research shows the implications of this approach for environmental degradation, the depletion of non-renewable resources and energy production. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas in the late 1980s sustainable development was perceived as a matter of concern only to nations, there has been an increased awareness about the fact that it permeates all parts of our lives. Some of the trends related to the evolution of sustainable development can be seen among various sectors, also at universities. Due to their relevance, universities are uniquely placed to pass on the messages of sustainable development to a wide audience. Yes, this potential has not yet been fully realised. This paper describes the evolution of the concept of sustainable development and process behind the its establishment at university level, including an analysis of the problems related to it and their roots.

In addition, it depicts the cyclical patterns of political activity dealing with sustainability and identifies the main sustainability goals and targets endorsed by several political initiatives. These tasks are accomplished through a literature review and an assessment of indicators dealing with political will. It is concluded that global sustainability governance followed an intermittent path characterized by two periods of significant accomplishments (until 1979; 1987-1995) and by two others less successful (1980-1986; 1995 onwards, interrupted by a peak around 2000). Peaks in political activity coincide with the decennial Earth Summits, suggesting their major influence as catalysts of more profound societal and political action. Sustainability concerns and goals shifted from an emphasis on pollution control and availability of natural resources to a more balanced position that puts human development at the center.

In line with the 1992 Rio Declaration principles of sustainable development, the paper suggests sustainability principles relating to community participation as more relevant for the field of cultural heritage resource management in Botswana. The article illustrates this relevance by exploring and drawing out production and consumption indicators of cultural heritage resources in both their tangible and intangible composition. It concludes that participation principles of sustainable development are more applicable as a point of departure towards integration of sustainability into cultural heritage resource management as communities are carriers and immediate custodians of cultural resources in Africa. Conservation processes that set limits of acceptable change for resource use are suggested within a modified framework that links community interaction with cultural resources at both social and resource management levels.

"J","WOS:000288145200010",2011,"The Implementation of Sustainable Development","This article presents an evaluation of the chances for and the implementation of sustainable development within the context of relevant philosophical literature. The starting point of the discussion is presentation of the divergent views among various authors regarding this question, and examination of the reasons for these differences. What emerges is that these are the result of differences in what is understood as sustainable development, especially in the axiological value of the content of this concept. Consequently, two postulates for conducting research into the philosophical literature of this nature are formulated. The first involves starting the analysis with the identification of the philosophical and axiological options in the version of sustainable development under analysis. The second postulate is to restrict the application of the empirical- analytical perspective to only those cases in which it is possible taking into consideration the value system embodied in the society and identifying the relevant social entity for the implementation of the system. Next, the constitutive features of a philosophy of sustainable development as a normative theory are outlined. This role is played by the Socratic imperative of the primacy of the theoretical mind over the practical. Therefore, the same line as in philosophical tradition can be drawn between a philosophy of sustainable development and projects for the improvement of life that propagate concrete cultural, religious or ideological ideals. Finally, such projects are juxtaposed against the version of sustainable development that belongs to the conceptual achievements of the UN.

"J","WOS:000288978100001",2011,"Critical perspectives of sustainable development research and practice","Sustainable development has been intensely debated for more than twenty years, but real progress of our societies to become more sustainable is very slow. Therefore this special issue provides a forum for critical perspectives of Sustainable Development Research and Practice. The papers are grouped into three clusters: a. Sustainability Science, b. Economic Problems and c. Corporate Contributions to Sustainable Development. Although a single special issue cannot address the entire array of issues pertaining to progress of sustainability related research, the selected papers highlight special aspects of sustainability research either due to their theoretical contributions or because they report on valuable empirical evidence. The main goal of sustainability research should be to contribute to our understanding of sustainability problems and to develop and help to implement solutions to solve them. This can be described as the relevance of sustainability research. A precondition to gain relevance is the rigor of sustainability science: it has to be based on solid scientific principles and methods. Additionally it has to be regarded that Sustainable Development is dynamic and that it has both normative and practical aspects. It is concluded that sustainability science and practice should be based upon these four central aspects: rigor, relevance, normative aspects and dynamic (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While the Lisbon Strategy was a genuinely European policy response to global economic and social pressures, which was superseded by the 'Europe 2020' strategy in 2010, sustainable development strategies are ongoing cyclical processes that aim to better coordinate and integrate economic, social and, in particular, environmental policies at both the EU and Member State levels. This paper explores the horizontal governance linkages that existed between the two strategies. It first contrasts the Council rhetoric, emphasizing the complementarity of the two strategies with their different histories and governance arrangements. This paper then shows that the Council rhetoric of complementarity never materialized in the everyday governance routines of the two strategies, and provides three explanations for this finding. Based on these findings, this paper finally provides a brief outlook discussion on how to proceed with the governance of sustainable development in Europe.","COORDINATION; POLITICS","sustainable development strategy; Lisbon Strategy; horizontal policy integration; environmental policy integration (EPI)","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Steurer, R##Berger, G","[Steurer, Reinhard] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy InFER, Vienna, Austria.

This paper examines how sustainable intellectual capital helps to overcome the shortcomings of conventional approaches to environmental management systems. It does this by extending the concept of sustainability from relational capital to the three pillars of intellectual capital: human, structural and relational intellectual capital. A multiple case study was carried out with Spanish firms characterized by their high level of environmental leadership. The findings indicated that sustainable human intellectual capital, environmental training, information and awareness sessions help in the accumulation and utilization of knowledge. As for sustainable structural intellectual capital, the environmental technology portfolio is improved and new environmental departments are created. Regarding sustainable relational intellectual capital, the firm-environment link is very important. In the primary and secondary sectors suppliers become involved to a greater extent in the environmental management process, whereas in the service sector it is the customer who becomes more involved.

It discusses how the concept resonates with debates on sustainable development, and how the key elements of sustainable adaptation presented in the literature relate to sustainable development. It discusses three major challenges to the promotion and implementation of sustainable adaptation and achievement of its objectives. First, many current approaches to adaptation are far from sustainable. Second, the relationships between poverty reduction and adaptation to climate change are complex and highly context specific. Third, sustainable adaptation may be co-opted to support development-as-usual rather than more radical options which put social justice, equity and environmental sustainability at the core.","COPING STRATEGIES; PRO-POOR; VULNERABILITY; POVERTY; MOZAMBIQUE; RESPONSES; CONTEXT; DROUGHT; KENYA","adaptation; maladaptation; poverty; sustainable development","CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT","Brown, K","[Brown, Katrina] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.

This concern has however not prevented the suggestion of a relationship between sustainable development and EIAs. As a result, there is a need to develop a more formal conceptual basis for the relationship between EIA and sustainable development. The paper discusses the conceptual development of a geocybernetic perspective of the relationship between sustainable development and EIAs in respect to impact identification methodologies. The paper considers the five fundamental geocybernetic paradigms of sustainable development, uses relevant literature to support the relationships found, and provides examples to support the relationships developed within the paper.

The challenge is at all scales of development and participation. Finding and validating methodological approaches has become urgent. Existing decision processes such as multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA), multi-objective decision making (MODM), life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are frequently used, with varying degrees of satisfaction reported. It appears that sustainable development can be assessed and analysed in different ways, any of which may be of use but none of which seems to be complete. The use of all, however, appears to involve such complexity as to be not feasible. There is a need for a more integrated and systematic approach to decision-making. In this paper, existing decision aid processes and frameworks are reviewed, and a novel evolutionary approach is proposed that can support them all. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paradigm is being introduced as sustainable, durable, self-sustaining, or eco-development. The article is trying to answer two important questions: first - Is sustainable development as legal representative of this new paradigm enough developed concept of development? Secondly - what is the role of integrated order in this refinement? Integrated order is here understood as benchmarking essence of sustainable development, as positive target of developmental changes merging in consistent way different orders: economic, social (including institutional-political) and environmental (including spatial). As minimal axiological level of orders formation moderate anthropocentrism was indicated. Ways of consideration and decoding sustainable development as integrated order vary depending on scientific field and discipline. The article is showing this phenomenon on the example of few scientific research centers.","NEEDS TRANSLATION","paradigm; sustainable development; integrated order; benchmarking","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Borys, T","Uniwersytet Ekon Wroclawiu, Wydzial Jeleniej Gorze, Katedra Zarzadzania Jakoscia & Srodowiskiem, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Borys T., 2005, WSKAZNIKI ZROWNOWAZO##BORYS T, 1999, WSKAZNIKI EKOROZWOJU, P63##BORYS T, 2010, WYZWANIA ZROWNOWAZON##BORYS T, 2010, ARGUM OECON, P5##DIEFENBACHER H, 2010, EKONOMIA ZROWNOWAZON##KOLODZIEJSKI J, 1994, EUROPEJSKIE STUDIA B, P37##Kozlowski S., 1994, DROGA EKOROZWOJU##PLATEK Z, 2011, PROBL EKOROZW, V6, P83##Poskrobko B., 2010, EKONOMIA ZROWNOWAZON##Rogall H., 2009, NACHHALTIGE OKONOMIE##Rogall H., 2010, EKONOMIA ZROWNOWAZON EKONOMIA ZROWNOWAZON##SKOWRONSKA A, 2010, ROLA POLITYKI LOGIST##Sztumski W, 2008, PROBL EKOROZW, V3, P133##Zacher LW, 2008, PROBL EKOROZW, V3, P63##ZAUFAL B, 1987, AURA, P27",44,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM1","no","SDG.9"

Debates about sustainability no longer consider sustainability solely as an environmental concern, but also incorporate economic and social dimensions. However, while a social dimension to sustainability is widely accepted, exactly what this means has not been very clearly defined or agreed. This paper aims to address this disparity through a detailed exploration and definition of the concept of social sustainability within the urban context.

The anthropocentrism is based on the fulfillment of basic interests and vital needs of human being by avoiding or reducing damage to nature. For its part, biocentrism seeks recognize the intrinsic value of species, allowing the use of nature but not its exploitation or domination.

"J","WOS:000298985500003",2012,"Rethinking the accounting stance on sustainable development","This paper investigates the sustainability initiatives of the accounting profession in support of sustainable development. This is important because the post-Rio sustainability agenda involves the role of accounting in directing corporate behaviour; however, a review of critical literature indicates censure of accounting as being apathetic to society and environment. To see whether this criticism still holds, using a desktop research approach, the paper proceeds to investigate the sustainability initiatives contained in the web portals of selected accounting bodies. Findings indicate appreciable levels of initiatives to sustainable development; however, lack of standards, regulations and uniform accounting schemes still poses a challenge such that contemporary sustainability accounting appears more like a weak approximation of the triple bottom line. It concludes that accounting requires a more pragmatic response to sustainable development, as this would facilitate government and institutional policies towards sustainability, and recommends that vital aspects of response should include carbon accounting standards, regulated sustainability accounting and the formation of engineering accounting in order to address the challenges of climate change and carbon trading.

This also relates to the sport. Sport events like Olympic Games or the World Cups are the huge events which can have the large, negative influence on the environment. Therefore the efforts are undertaken to organize such events to ensure that this influence will be the smallest. The previous European Football Cup, organized by Austria and Switzerland, has showed that it is possible to reduce the Carbon Footprint of these events and prepare them in line with the sustainable development principle. The analysis of the preparations of EURO 2012 in Poland shows that the country has not draw out conclusions from the experiences of EURO 2008. There is a lack of environmental questions in the Polish public debate about championships, the sustainable strategy has not been prepared, the environmental objectives has not been defined. It can be recognised that the constitutional principle of the sustainable development in Poland is understood in the very narrow way, as the realization of environment protection projects and not as the integration of environmental aims to the strategy of the socio-economic development.",NA,"sustainable development; sport; sustainable sport events","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Karaczun, ZM","SGGW, Katedra Ochrony Srodowiska, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ADAMIEC K., 2008, INFOS, V1##[Anonymous], 2008, EURO 2008 SUST REP E##[Anonymous], 2004, GREEN GOAL LEG REP##BRUNDTLAND Commission, 1987, OUR COMM FUT##BUDIL B., 2007, AURO SWISS SUSTAINAB##CEBDS, 2010, GUID SUST MEG EV##Collins A, 2009, TOURISM MANAGE, V30, P828, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2008.12.006##Dickson C, 2010, INT J HOSP MANAG, V29, P236, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhm.2009.10.013##Europejski Komitet Spoleczno-Ekonomiczny, 2005, O J C, V157, P0015##EUROSTAT, 2009, SUST DEV EU 2009 MON##Galuszka A, 2009, PROBL EKOROZW, V4, P123##HULL Z, 2007, PROBL EKOROZW, V2, P49##IOC, 2006, GUID SPORT ENV SUST##Karaczun Z, 2005, LAND USE POLICY, V22, P245, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2003.09.007##Komisja Europejska, 2007, KOM2007391 KOM EUR, P391##Komisja Europejska, 2007, SEC2007936 KOM EUR, P936##Komisja Prawna PE, 2006, 20062130INI##MOGIELNICKA D., 2010, WPLYW ORG UEFA EURO##NIK, 2010, INF WYN KONTR PRZYG##PAP, 2008, MIN SROD SROD EURO 2##Paschalis-Jakubowicz P, 2011, PROBL EKOROZW, V6, P101##Pawlowski A, 2009, PROBL EKOROZW, V4, P65##PLADERER C., 2008, COMP LIFE CYCLE ASSE##Redclift MR, 2009, PROBL EKOROZW, V4, P33##Russell DL, 2010, PROBL EKOROZW, V5, P15##Skowronski A, 2006, PROBL EKOROZW, V1, P47##SZTUMSKI W., 2006, PROBL EKOROZW, V1, P73##TUSK D., 2007, SPRAWOZDANIA SCENOGR##WACHTER D., 2008, ESDN C 2008 COORD SC",0,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM1","no","SDG.12#SDG.13"

The regional transport system should be integrated in the European transport system. It supposes the rehabilitation and improvement of the regional transport and local infrastructure. So, the extension and the updating of the railway network and the improvement of the service quality, the modernisation of the naval transport infrastructure on the navigable ways and channels in the west region are the two directions by which transport becomes friendlier with the environment. Neither the air transport infrastructure is neglected, which is modernised by investments made in the international Traian Vuia airport of Timisoara.

Access to energy is a crucial enabling condition for achieving sustainable development. Prudent energy policies and research can play an important role in steering both industrialized and developing countries onto more sustainable energy development paths. Specifically, they can strengthen the three pillars of sustainable development: the economy, by boosting productivity; social welfare, by improving living standards and enhancing safety and security; and the environment, by reducing indoor and outdoor pollution and remediating environmental degradation. Many factors that need to be considered and appropriately addressed in moving towards energy sustainability in Nigeria are examined in this article. These include full exploitation and promotion of renewable energy resources and application of energy conservation measures in various sectors such as manufacturing industrial set-up, office and residential buildings and transportation.

"J","WOS:000306672500002",2011,"Doing research on education for sustainable development","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the research preferences and differences of education for sustainable development (ESD) researchers. A model with the continuums assimilation-accommodation and adaptation-agency was applied resulting in quantitative, qualitative, theoretic and participative research orientations. Design/methodology/approach - Reunamo's general model of agentive perception was used, to design the 32-item questionnaire, Research for ESD so as to reveal the degree to which the researchers are accommodating their thoughts and actions to real phenomenon, and considering their research as having theoretical or practical agency. The questionnaire was administered to 83 ESD researchers, mainly from European countries. Findings - The most valuable discovery was the desire of ESD researchers to contribute to societal development. The results describe the first continuum of research activity with the need for opening up to the requisites and possibilities of environmental change while applying the existing prerequisites of scientific rigour and validity. The second continuum highlights the research as a knowledge resource for just political or individual choices on the one hand, and the direct application of the models and actions for needed change on the other hand. Research limitations/implications - It would be difficult to create a reliable register of FSD researchers worldwide. Thus, the opportunity sample of FSD researchers available to the authors was used in the study. Practical implications - The model, after adjustments, appears to be a promising tool in the study of research orientations. To study complex and controversial subjects such as sustainable development, the researchers need to be aware of their preferences and orientations. Originality/value - The paper shows the possibilities of the agentive perception model in the case of ESD researchers.",NA,"Education; Sustainable development; Researchers; Research methods","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Reunamo, J##Pipere, A","[Pipere, Anita] Daugavpils Univ, Fac Educ & Management, Inst Sustainable Educ, Daugavpils, Latvia.

"J","WOS:000307485000005",2012,"Sustainable Development: the upcoming civilizational revolution?","In this work the concept of sustainable development is presented as the currently most important revolutionary project in our civilisation, which should rapidly change the way people think and act globally. The aim of this revolution should be the distancing from, or the overcoming of difficulties which beset the modern world, resulting from the growing disharmony and ecological imbalance between the global community and our planet's entire natural environment. The basis for the analysis is Artur Pawlowski's book entitled Sustainable Development as a Civilizational Revolution. A Multidisciplinary Approach to the Challenges of the 21st Century. The author presents multilateral arguments for the necessity of such a global revolution related to civilisation. This idea is discussed and compared with other views on the world's future and the possibility of realising within it the concept of sustainable development in terms of business, economic, political, social and awareness activities. Pawlowski's view has been categorised as a form of hypothetical rationalism and realism, and continues the Polish traditional way of thinking in this field. In modern analysis, the author's view on the possibility of realising sustainable development can be placed between Klaus Bosselmann's optimism and Christian de Duve's pessimism.",NA,"sustainable development; global civilizational revolution; optimism; realistic and pessimistic worldview","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Fiut, IS","AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Humanities, Dept Culture Study & Philosophy, PL-30071 Krakow, Poland.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","BOSSELMAN K., 2010, J COURT INNOVATION, V3, P337##BOSSELMANN K, 2008, PRINCIPLE SUSTAINABL##BOSSELMANN K., 2009, WAY FORWARD, P173##CROSBY A.W., 1999, IMPERIALIZM EKOLOGIC##DE KERCKOHOVE D., 2009, KODY MCLUHANA TOPOGR, P83##DeDuve Christian, 2010, GENETICS ORIGINAL SI##FIUT I.S., 2011, ESTETYKA KRYTYKA, P65##FIUT I.S., 1999, EKOETYKI KIERUNKI RO##Fiut Ignacy S., 2003, EKOFILOZOFIA GENEZA##Godden L, 2009, OSGOODE HALL LAW J, V47, P807##HARDIN G, 1968, SCIENCE, V162, P1243, DOI 10.1126/science.162.3859.1243##Hardin G, 1998, SCIENCE, V280, P682, DOI 10.1126/science.280.5364.682##Ikerd J, 2008, PROBL EKOROZW, V3, P13##Papuzinski A, 2011, PROBL EKOROZW, V6, P107##PAWLOWSKI A., 1999, ODPOWIEDZIALNOSC CZL##PAWLOWSKI A., 2001, ZESZYTY NAUKOWE POLI##PAWLOWSKI A., 2011, SUSTAINABBLE DEV CIV##PAWLOWSKI A., 2008, MONOGRAFIE KOMITETU, V51##Pawlowski A, 2008, PROBL EKOROZW, V3, P7##Piatek Z, 2008, EKOFILOZOFIA##Piatek Z, 1998, ETYKA SRODOWISKOWA N##Piatek Z, 2011, PROBL EKOROZW, V6, P83##Sztumski Wieslaw, 2008, QUO RUIS HOMO SRODOW##Weiss M., 2010, ETYKA EWOLUCJA METAE",6,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM5","no",NA

The outcome document titled ""The Future We Want"" alludes to a grand vision for addressing global challenges in the framework of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental. But the 53-page long document only reiterates promises made elsewhere. It fails to lay out a coherent roadmap forward, much less to define binding targets with specific deadlines. The declaration, however, does reflect a changing political reality in international negotiations. Developing countries are playing a much more assertive role in pushing poverty eradication as the overarching priority than at any time before.

For this reason, elements of the sustainable development have been discussed. Special attention has been given to activities concerning the European Union strategy on the protection and welfare of animals. The problem is highly significant because of the fact that the common European Union policy does not include many questions of animal welfare, such as variety of systems for agricultural production, climate conditions or others. One of the main mechanisms of the CAP is cross-compliance. It was found that the principles of cross-compliance are closely related and are important in the implementation of measures for the sustainable development of agriculture. These requirements should be met by beneficiaries in order to obtain financial aid for production, for maximal reduction of a negative impact of agricultural activities on the environment and the health safety of humans and animals, animal welfare and food security. The study is aimed at an interview of actions for the sustainable development of agriculture with a special reference to animal production.",NA,"sustainable development of agriculture; determinants of sustainable development; animal welfare; cross-compliance","TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS","Bartkowiak, A##Bartkowiak, P","[Bartkowiak, Anna] Inst Technol & Life Sci, Poznan Branch, PL-60463 Poznan, Poland.

However, different understandings of sustainability, definitions of SDIs and measurement procedures may give completely different assessments of whether society moves towards a sustainable development path or not. Compilation of statistical indicators for environmental change and sustainability comprises not only a selection of facts in some technical sense, as the choices involved are conditioned by societal interests and implicit values embedded in the data-generating processes. This implies that statistical offices cannot ignore the role that values play in the generation of accurate data sets. To give an assessment of sustainability, we need not only to address historical trends but also to evaluate policy choices made today and how they may influence future development. SDI sets should be evaluated according to how they contribute to deliberation on sustainability in learning processes involving participants beyond the sciencepolicy interface.

A CASE STUDY","The purpose of this paper is to offer sustainable development indicators, which serve to measure and evaluate the level of implementation of sustainable development policy by real estate development companies. It seems particularly important to understand the nature and the criteria of elaborating methodologically the appropriate indicators. The proposed indicators are grouped according to the criteria of four aspects of the concept (environmental, economical, social and spatial). It was decided to offer only the sample indicators, which can measure both internal sustainable development policy in company and its external dimension. The proposals of sustainable indicators presented in this paper represent only a small part of the tools which serve to measure the degree of implementation of sustainable development policy in real estate development company's strategy. It is suggested to asses the level of implementation of sustainable development concept by comparing relevant indicators of company with those achieved in a sector leader company. The main value of this paper is a practical, not just general, set of indicators proposed which can be used to measure the value added for a company and its competitive advantage. These indicators are a universal set, which can be used by companies from other sectors of the economy.",NA,"sustainable development; indicators; real estate development companies; land use","ACTUAL PROBLEMS OF ECONOMICS","Bernat, T##Bartkowiak, P","[Bernat, Tomasz] Tech Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Szczecin, Poland.

"J","WOS:000311607500002",2012,"How Does Tourism Planning Contribute to Sustainable Development?","Perhaps like few other industries, tourism depends and is built on environmental, physical and cultural local resources. In this sense, and as suggested by the scientific community and international agencies, sustainability should be a driver for tourism sector development. For this purpose, three main issues are relevant: the interpretation of the meaning of sustainability reflected in the vision of the destination for the sector; stakeholders' participation, balancing different approaches; and a strategic planning that calls for long-term view and action. The aim of this study is to assess whether the tourism planning of the destinations contributes to sustainable development. We have reviewed 11 local/regional tourism plans existing in Portugal, and the conclusions point to a vague interpretation of the concept of sustainability, to a type of planning that is closed to public participation with a lack of discussion on the kind of sustainability to implement and to difficulties in committing to strategic planning.

This study quantitatively assesses some alternative scenarios using integrated assessment models, and provides several indicators relating to sustainable development and climate change, such as indicators of income (per capita GDP), poverty, water stress, food access, sustainable energy use, energy security, and ocean acidification, with high consistencies among the indicators within a scenario. According to the analyses, economic growth helps improve many of the indicators for sustainable development. On the other hand, climate change will induce some severe impacts such as ocean acidification under a non-climate intervention scenario (baseline scenario). Deep emission reductions, such as to 2 degrees C above the pre-industrial level, could cause some sustainable development indicators to worsen.

"J","WOS:000312529900006",2013,"Local government: facilitator or inhibitor of sustainable tourism development?","Governments at all levels have assumed greater responsibility for, and involvement in, tourism destination planning and development. In the post-Brundtland era local governments in particular have been under closer scrutiny for their role in driving the sustainable development agenda in tourism destination contexts. Yet, a notable research gap still exists despite the increased focus on local government, particularly in terms of empirical research investigating the roles and responsibilities of local government in addressing sustainable tourism development. Given this context, this paper explores the role of local government in facilitating, or indeed inhibiting, sustainable development objectives in a tourism destination context. To assess this issue, it uses in-depth interviews with local government representatives and key destination stakeholders from five local government areas in Queensland, Australia. It shows that local government had assumed responsibility for facilitating the sustainable tourism agenda, due to the absence of strong industry leadership and due to top-down directives from state and federal governments. However, power struggles, tokenistic public participation and the strong influence of the local government authority in local governance structures were found to be inhibitors to sustainable tourism development.","POLICY-MAKING; GOVERNANCE; COLLABORATION; ATTITUDES; PARTICIPATION; CHALLENGES; NETWORKS; POWER; VIEW","sustainable development; local government; stakeholders; planning; tourism destination","JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM","Ruhanen, L","Univ Queensland, Sch Tourism, Postgrad Coursework Program, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics","Aas C, 2005, ANN TOURISM RES, V32, P28, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2004.04.005##[Anonymous], 2004, IND SUST DEV TOUR DE##Aronsson L., 2000, DEV SUSTAINABLE TOUR##Ashworth G.

"J","WOS:000312617400020",2013,"Methods of measuring sustainable development of the German energy sector","The availability of sustainability indicators is a precondition for the conversion of the model of sustainable development into policy. Sustainability indicators define characteristics that are important for sustainable development. A single sustainability indicator defines a key issue, which characterizes a certain aspect of sustainability in the observed system. Sustainability indicator systems capture the complexity and order of the systems, and they offer new knowledge about the system that can be communicated to the general public. That is why in 2002 the German Government developed a sustainability indicator set for its sustainability strategy, including indicators for a sustainability energy system within this comprehensive strategy. The Government thereby defined a sustainable order for Germany based on the theme-based sustainability approach. The sustainability indicators thus have to measure the difference between the real and the normatively defined sustainability order: Do the individual preferences of society (households, enterprises) correspond to the sustainability order of the Government, is the implicit preference order of society congruent with the explicit order of the Government as expressed in the national sustainability strategy? The question of the measurability of sustainability is the key to the implementation of sustainable development of the energy sector. The index of sustainable development (ISUD) and the standardized sustainability index (SSEI), developed by the authors, calculate the degree to which sustainability is achieved. Both indices show whether Germany is on a sustainable energy path according to the goals set by the German Government in its strategy, but from a different perspective. The indices enable us to compare the normatively (politically) defined sustainability order of the German Government (goals) with the actual ""behaviour"" of German society. Both indices enable us to answer the question of whether the German energy sector is ""better off"" in sustainable categories.

Yet, the perception of the potential and risks of sustainability indicator systems influences the success of their implementation. In view of this correlation and the existing research gaps, we investigate the perceived contribution of indicator systems to sustainable development in five Asian cities of developing countries. Thirty interviews with local key actors have been held and a Qualitative Content Analysis has been conducted, drawing on the interview material. Results include a typology of positive and negative contributions based on the type of indicator systems' use, as well as a quantitative description of the level of awareness of different actors. Perceived positive and negative contributions are discussed considering the actors' functions, experiences and cities. The research shows that developers of sustainability indicator systems and scholars have the most awareness concerning risks whereas users and potential users are lacking this, and it portrays future implementation requirements.

"J","WOS:000314354200001",2013,"Does the CDM offer sustainable development benefits or not?","The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol has the explicit objective to both reduce greenhouse gases emissions and support sustainable development (SD) in developing countries. An important aspect that remains an open issue is how the CDM contributes to the three main dimensions of SD, namely environmental, social and economic. Although an extensive literature has emerged focusing on the different aspects of the CDM, the necessity for the sustainability assessment of the CDM projects still remains. Moreover, existing CDM analysis is dominated by studies of CDM projects in Brazil, Mexico, India and China. Within the thousands of CDM projects globally, Africa only has 251 projects in the CDM pipeline and accordingly limited research has been conducted. To cover this knowledge gap regarding sustainability performance in African countries, this paper presents a methodological approach for the SD benefits' assessment of the CDM projects in developing countries. To this end, appropriate SD criteria and indicators were selected to measure the performance of the CDM projects according to SD dimensions. The proposed approach lays emphasis on the SD benefits of CDM projects in Kenya, which was selected as a priority country, in terms of its potential for CDM projects. The results from the SD benefits' assessment of the CDM projects in Africa would be important, especially in policy-making and in countries where high CDM potential has been indicated.","CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES; HOST COUNTRIES; PROJECTS; OPPORTUNITIES; INDIA","sustainable development; local development benefits; clean development mechanism; developing countries; Africa","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Karakosta, C##Marinakis, V##Letsou, P##Psarras, J","[Karakosta, Charikleia; Marinakis, Vangelis; Psarras, John] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Management & Decis Support Syst Lab EPU NTUA, Athens 15780, Greece.

This paper therein attempts to offer a representation of Europe's current situation of sustainable development in the area of public health. Methods: A dataset on sustainable development in the area of public health consisting of 31 European countries (formally proposed by the European Union Commission and EUROSTAT) has been used in this paper in order to evaluate said issue for the countries listed thereof. A statistical method which synthesizes several indicators into one quantitative indicator has also been utilized. Furthermore, the applied method offers the possibility to obtain an optimal set of variables for future studies of the problem, as well as for the possible development of indicators. Results: According to the results obtained, Norway and Iceland are the two foremost European countries regarding sustainable development in the area of public health, whereas Romania, Lithuania, and Latvia, some of the European Union's newest Member States, rank lowest. The results also demonstrate that the most significant variables (more than 80%) in rating countries are found to be ""healthy life years at birth, females"" (r(2) = 0.880), ""healthy life years at birth, males"" (r(2) = 0.864), ""death rate due to chronic diseases, males"" (r(2) = 0.850), and ""healthy life years, 65, females"" (r(2) = 0.844). Conclusions: Based on the results of this paper, public health represents a precondition for sustainable development, which should be continuously invested in and improved. After the assessment of the dataset, proposed by EUROSTAT in order to evaluate progress towards the agreed goals of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS), this paper offers an improved set of variables, which it is hoped, may initiate further studies concerning this problem.","ENVIRONMENT; INDICATORS; LINKS","Public health; Sustainable development; I-distance method; Rating countries","BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","Seke, K##Petrovic, N##Jeremic, V##Vukmirovic, J##Kilibarda, B##Martic, M","[Seke, Kristina] Inst Publ Hlth Serbia Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut, Commun Ctr, Belgrade, Serbia.

The 2011 Human Development Report rightly focuses on the integral links between sustainability and equity. However, the human development and capabilities approach emphasizes the expansion of people's capabilities simpliciter, which is questionable in view of environmental sustainability. We argue that capabilities should be defined as triadic relations between an agent, constraints and possible functionings. This triadic syntax particularly applies to climate change: since people's lives and capabilities are dependent on the environment, sustainable human development should also include constraining human activities in order to prevent losses in future people's well-being due to the adverse effects of exacerbated climate change. On this basis, we will advocate that the goals of sustainable human development should be informed by a framework that consists of enhancing capabilities up to a threshold level, as well as constraining the functionings beyond this threshold in terms of their greenhouse gas emissions.","CAPABILITY APPROACH; JUSTICE; FREEDOM; ETHICS","Sustainable human development; 2011 Human Development Report; Capabilities; Climate change","JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES","Peeters, W##Dirix, J##Sterckx, S","[Peeters, Wouter; Dirix, Jo; Sterckx, Sigrid] Free Univ Brussels, Ctr Eth & Humanism, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.

However, the concept of sustainable development (SD) has developed independently from the input of educators; therefore, ESD presents current teachers with many challenges. At this point, understanding how stakeholders in the education sector (school students, student teachers, and teachers) view SD is of great importance. We selected a sample of 113 Turkish student science teachers from this body of stakeholders and distributed a questionnaire to them that included two separate sections. In the first section, questions regarding personal information such as gender, age, and year group were asked, whereas the meaning of SD was the focus of the second part. A phenomenographic approach was used to analyse student teachers' descriptions of SD. The results showed that student teachers had a variety of ideas about SD that could be collected under headings such as environment, technology, society, economy, politics, energy, and education. In addition, we thought that gender, context-based issues, and informal experiences might be responsible for the variety of the responses.","ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES; ENGINEERING STUDENTS; GENDER; EDUCATION; PERCEPTION; GEOGRAPHY","Student teachers; Sustainable development; Education for sustainable development; Phenomenography","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION","Kilinc, A##Aydin, A","[Kilinc, Ahmet; Aydin, Abdullah] Ahi Evran Univ, Dept Elementary Sci Educ, TR-40100 Kirsehir, Turkey.","Education & Educational Research","Education & Educational Research","Azapagic A, 2005, EUR J ENG EDUC, V30, P1, DOI 10.1080/03043790512331313804##Barnard A, 1999, QUAL HEALTH RES, V9, P212, DOI 10.1177/104973299129121794##Bonnett M., 2002, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V8, P9, DOI DOI 10.1080/13504620120109619##Bord RJ, 1997, SOC SCI QUART, V78, P830##Bouras B., 2007, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V16, P443, DOI [DOI 10.1007/S10956-007-9061-7, 10.1007/s10956-007-9061-7]##Burger J, 2000, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V60, P145, DOI 10.1023/A:1006104329182##Chatzifotiou A, 2006, CURRIC J, V17, P367, DOI 10.1080/09585170601072478##Childs A., 2007, RES SCI TECHNOLOGICA, V25, P307, DOI [DOI 10.1080/02635140701535067, 10.1080/02635140701535067]##Chrystalbridge M., 2002, ED SUSTAINABLE DEV T##CORNEY G, 2000, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V6, P313, DOI DOI 10.1080/713664695##Corney G, 2006, INT RES GEOGR ENVIRO, V15, P224, DOI 10.2167/irgee194.0##Cross R.

"J","WOS:000316878000004",2013,"A discourse-analytical perspective on sustainability assessment: interpreting sustainable development in practice","Sustainable development is a ubiquitously used concept in public decision-making: it refers to an ideal vision of global society where human development and environmental quality go hand in hand. Logically, any decision-supporting process aiming at facilitating and steering society toward a sustainable future then seems desirable. Assessing the sustainability of policy decisions is, however, influenced by what sustainable development is believed to entail, as different discourses coexist under the umbrella of the sustainable development meta-discourse. This paper proposes a typology of sustainable development discourses, and, subsequently, applies a discourse-analytical lens on two practical cases of sustainability assessment in different institutional and geographical contexts (in Belgium and in Benin). The results indicate that sustainability assessments tend to be influenced mainly by the consensual 'sustainable development as integration' discourse, while also providing a forum for dialogue between different discourses. The results shed light on context-specific discursive and institutional dynamics for the development and application of sustainability assessment. Acknowledging these dynamics as well as sustainable development's inherent interpretational limits can lead to an improved use of sustainable development as a decision-guiding strategy.","FRAMEWORK; ENVIRONMENT; RESILIENCE; FUTURES; ISSUES; POLICY","Sustainable development; Discourse analysis; Sustainability assessment; Belgium; Benin","SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE","Huge, J##Waas, T##Dahdouh-Guebas, F##Koedam, N##Block, T","[Huge, Jean; Waas, Tom; Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid; Koedam, Nico] Vrije Univ Brussel, Lab Plant Biol & Nat Management, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.

"J","WOS:000318177300006",2013,"The Politics of Knowing ""Organizational Sustainable Development""","We critically examine organizational representations of sustainable development in 197 publicly available corporate reports. Using a discourse theoretical approach, we analyze how these organizations have come to ""know"" sustainable development, and we consider the conditions that made this knowledge possible. Themes identified are (a) enlightened self-interest and the business case, (b) organizational sustainable development as a balancing act, (c) organizational sustainable development as necessary and important, (d) being sustainable as responsibility and/or obligation, (e) organizational sustainable development as challenge and opportunity, and (f) sustainable development as a new and an old concept. Taken-for-granted assumptions in corporate reports emphasize organizational ability to manage sustainably underpinned by optimism about technological advancements, continuous improvement, and efficiencies. The organizational construction of sustainable development ""accommodates"" current organizations and systems of organizing. More extensive and compelling engagement with the discourse is required by both practitioners and academics, and with each other-if an environmentally, socially, and economically enabling construction of sustainable development is to be realized.","GREEN; BUSINESS","organizational discourse; sustainable development; reporting; taken-for-granted assumptions; legitimation","ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT","Tregidga, H##Kearins, K##Milne, M","[Tregidga, Helen; Kearins, Kate] Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.

However, education and research on sustainability in universities is at an early stage in many institutions. This introduction highlights findings from articles, most of which were presented at the Environmental Management for Sustainable Universities (EMSU) 2010 conference, held at Delft, the Netherlands. The articles contribute to answering the questions: 1. Are universities leading in the development of sustainable development mental models and paradigms and in transferring the related sustainable development memes to their students or are they reacting to stimuli from society and thus the sustainable development memes are being transferred to the universities from the society? 2. What can university leaders and their faculty do to ensure that sustainable development becomes an integral part of the University's culture? The starting point of this special volume is a paper on declarations and initiatives for Education for Sustainable Development which is complemented by a paper on inter-linking the declarations to the university's commitment and policies. Two papers explore campus operations and greenhouse gases, whilst three papers focus on curricula for sustainable development. Then two papers are included, which address multi-stakeholder regional collaboration, via linking the university to small and medium size enterprises through sustainable development initiatives. They are complemented with new perspectives on attitudes and perceptions of students to environmental and sustainability issues. The final two papers focus on transdisciplinary research and on a new metaphor designed to help faculty, students and societal members work is harmony with our ecosystem. Collectively, these articles provide an encouraging, holistic and trans-disciplinary perspective on higher education for sustainable development via articles that provide critical reflections on methodological perspectives where 'the sciences meet the arts'. The articles were selected to encourage educators, globally to engage in sustainable development initiatives within and outside their universities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An approach to allocating effort and deriving carbon budgets is presented here based on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principles of responsibility, capability, and sustainable development. A transparent model to operationalize EASD is applied by applying quantitative proxies for these criteria, and results for selected countries and groups are presented. A robust result is that the mitigation burden calculated by the model is significantly greater for developed than developing countries. For individual countries the results vary depending on the parameters chosen. A middle value of the mitigation burden for South Africa of 15 GtCO(2)e over the first half of the 21st century is reported, with the greatest effort required when a starting year of 1970 is chosen and historical land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) emissions are excluded when accounting for responsibility. In a regime applicable to all, it is clear that although all countries must do more, some must do more than others. Policy relevance Equitable access to sustainable development is crucial to the climate negotiations. Quantified allocations are presented for South Africa and other countries, based on the UNFCCC principles of responsibility, capability, and sustainable development. It is shown that the mitigation burden given these principles must be significantly greater for developed than developing countries. The results are relevant to, inter alia, the upcoming 2013-2015 review and the negotiations under the Durban Platform.","CARBON; COMMITMENTS; MITIGATION; COUNTRIES","burden sharing; equity; mitigation; sustainable development; UNFCCC","CLIMATE POLICY","Winkler, H##Letete, T##Marquard, A","[Winkler, Harald; Letete, Thapelo; Marquard, Andrew] Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.","Environmental Studies; Public Administration","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration","Baer P, 2008, GREENHOUSE DEV RIGHT##BASIC experts, 2011, EQ ACC SUST DEV CONT##CASS/DRC, 2011, EQ ACC SUST DEV CONT##DEA (Department of Environmental Affairs), 2009, GREENH GAS INV 2000##den Elzen MGJ, 2007, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V10, P185, DOI 10.1016/j.envsci.2006.10.009##Dsouza M, 2011, EQUITABLE ACCESS SUS, P59##ESMAP (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program), 2010, BRAZ LOW CARB COUNTR##Gonzalez Miguez J.

This is of particular importance for the principle of sustainable development, which depends on the on-going civilizational change largely shaped by the social expectations. Therefore, the analysis of megatrends in the future civilizational changes becomes essential in the context of the achievement of sustainable development, which is discussed in this article.

The discussion takes into account environmental, social and economic aspects in accordance with the concept of sustainable development.","TURBINE NOISE; POLISH; ANNOYANCE; HEALTH; IMPACT; ENERGY","sustainable development; wind farms; renewable energy sources; health","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Mroczek, B##Kurpas, D##Klera, M","[Mroczek, Bozena] Pomeranian Med Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, PL-71240 Szczecin, Poland.

This paper gives an overview of the objectives and indicators employed in 24 national SD strategies across Europe, covering five different welfare-state models. After highlighting some structural features of SD strategies the paper explores how coherently they address environmental and social policies, measured against the objectives and indicators of the EU SD strategy. It is shown that environmental objectives and indicators are more coherent than social ones. Regarding the five socioeconomic models it was found that the significant variance regarding social policy objectives and indicators is mainly because some SD strategies from Mediterranean countries ignore this dimension of SD. The paper concludes that SD strategies in Europe (in particular the EU SD strategy) unfold only a fraction of their potential to better coordinate policies vertically across different levels of government. As this conclusion is confirmed by more qualitative research approaches, the European governance architecture for sustainable development is questioned in fundamental ways.

"J","WOS:000323077600005",2013,"A Review of Utopian Themes in Sustainable Development Discourse","Sustainable development is commonly traced to the Bruntland Report'. However, its origins wind their way back through earlier UN conferences, 18th and 19th century political economic thought, Rousseauian ideals, the modernism founded on Bacon and Descartes, early Christian utopianism, and classical utopias such as Republic and New Atlantis, which expressed themes of social justice, environmental stewardship and economic growth. This article follows these utopian themes back through the history of sustainable development thought, relying on contemporary histories and reviews of the field as well as certain original texts. We also identify these threads within, and their impact upon, contemporary narratives and debates. We conclude with the suggestion that awareness of these discursive streams can assist in the effective use of the tools and concepts available for sustainable development efforts.

"J","WOS:000324036400008",2012,"Sustainable and Integrated Development-A Critical Analysis","The words ""Sustainable Development"" are frequently used by very lightly, to the extent that they have lost their meaning. There is a presumption that for any perspective analysis or any development proposal, these two words are the most appropriate. Sustainability has been incorporated in the objectives of many studies. The historical model of industrialized societies in the 19th and 20th centuries served as the central notion of what constitutes development in both the cost-effectiveness and equity perspectives. According to some analysts, this path represents the model for global prosperity. However, a number of growing parallel literatures recognize the importance of diverse development pathways in achieving an environmentally and socio-economically better world. The term sustainable development does not bring forward all aspects of development. A new term that incorporates the wellbeing of all citizens through economic development and the preservation of the environment is needed. A ""Worth-living Integrated Development"" could be a term that combines economic development, social development and environmental protection.

By reducing the dependence on imported fuel and providing new employment opportunities, bioenergy production has the potential to stimulate local economies in developing countries. Yet, given the diversity of biomass resources, options, markets and scales, a better understanding of how well different bioenergy project types can provide sustainable development is needed. This analysis evaluated how the potential for sustainable development benefits differs across five bioenergy project types, in order to help identify which project types are best positioned to provide such benefits. It systematically examines the benefits claimed in project design documents for 77 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) bioenergy projects in India, Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa. The claimed sustainable development benefits differ as widely among bioenergy project types as among all other CDM project types. Among CDM bioenergy projects, those that rely on agricultural farm residues claim to offer the greatest number of benefits, while those that rely on industrial forest residues the fewest. Improved sustainability assessment of biomass energy project types, benefitting from a requirement for ongoing monitoring of sustainable development benefits and on-the-ground post-implementation evaluations, are needed to guide priority-setting for international mitigation finance and CDM reform efforts.","DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM PROJECTS; CDM; METHODOLOGY","biomass energy; sustainable development; CDM; least developed countries; carbon trading","CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT","Lee, CM##Lazarus, M","[Lee, Carrie M.; Lazarus, Michael] Stockholm Environm Inst, Seattle, WA USA.","Development Studies; Environmental Studies","Development Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Alexeew J, 2010, INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P, V10, P233, DOI 10.1007/s10784-010-9121-y##Atlas.ti GmbH, 2010, ATL TI VERS 6 2 16 Q##Chum H, 2011, RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION: SPECIAL REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE, P209##Cosbey A., 2006, REALIZING DEV DIVIDE##Disch D, 2010, CLIM DEV, V2, P50, DOI 10.3763/cdev.2010.0034##Faaij A.P.C., 2006, ENERGY SUSTAIN DEV, VX, P7, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0973-0826(08)60503-7##Fargione J, 2008, SCIENCE, V319, P1235, DOI 10.1126/science.1152747##Gilbertson Tamra, 2009, UPSETTING OFFSET POL, P57##Haya B, 2009, CLIM DEV, V1, P66, DOI 10.3763/cdev.2009.0002##Heuberger Renat, 2007, Environment Development and Sustainability, V9, P33, DOI 10.1007/s10668-005-9002-7##International Energy Agency, 2010, EN TECHN PERSP 2010##Johnston M, 2009, ENVIRON RES LETT, V4, DOI 10.1088/1748-9326/4/1/014004##Kossoy A, 2010, STATE TRENDS CARBON##LeBlanc D.

Sustainable development was introduced into geography education in Turkey with the new geography curriculum in 2005. However, it has traditionally been a largely omitted topic in the Turkish educational context including pre-service teacher education programmes. Since geography prospective teachers will be responsible for teaching sustainable development under the new curriculum, it is important to find out their perceptions and what they have been given through pre-service programs concerning sustainable development. Through a questionnaire, this research explored the perceptions of geography prospective teachers and their pre-service experiences concerning sustainable development. The data were collected in 6 geography teacher education programmes (that is the total number of programmes in Turkey) with 122 final year geography prospective teachers. According to the findings, a relatively high number of respondents (30%) seemed to be unaware of the concept of sustainable development. As for the pre-service programmes, which covered a wide range of interrelated issues and dimensions of sustainable development concerns, the data indicate that they are not sufficiently covered in a balanced manner. Additional findings are also presented in details in this paper.","EDUCATION","geography; prospective teachers; sustainable development; teacher education","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY","Ozel, A##Senyurt, S##Ozturk, M##Ozel, E","[Ozel, A.; Ozel, E.] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Educ, TR-43000 Kutahya, Turkey.

These systems are part of the water domain where much research has focused on sustainable development indicators to support decision-makers in selecting systems that are more sustainable. However, the interest in sustainable development indicators is low. This paper identifies conditions to engage the practitioners to inform their actions in regard to sustainable stormwater management. Empirical evidence has been obtained from interviews with water professionals from Swedish municipalities. The environmental-technical discourse of sustainable stormwater development is a strong barrier in the change process, to the neglect of the social aspects. In the interviews, reframing the discourse was possible in visions of future sustainable stormwater systems embracing green infrastructure. In action, primary conditions can support sustainable pathways in realizing this vision. The paper suggests further incentives for increased implementation of non-structural measures by developing the identified conditions.","WATER; INDICATORS; DRAINAGE; SYSTEMS; IMPEDIMENTS; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN","stormwater management; sustainable development; sustainable urban stormwater implementation; transition","URBAN WATER JOURNAL","Cettner, A##Ashley, R##Hedstrom, A##Viklander, M","[Cettner, Annicka; Ashley, Richard; Hedstrom, Annelie; Viklander, Maria] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, Div Architecture & Water, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden.","Water Resources","Water Resources","Ahern J, 2007, CITIES FUTURE INTEGR##Auckland Regional Council, 2009, LOW IMP DES VERS CON##Azar C, 1996, ECOL ECON, V18, P89, DOI 10.1016/0921-8009(96)00028-6##Bagheri A, 2007, SUSTAIN DEV, V15, P83, DOI 10.1002/sd.310##Barrett P, 2009, CONSTR MANAG ECON, V27, P935, DOI 10.1080/01446190903273943##Bijker W.E., 1987, SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION##Brown RR, 2006, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V54, P415, DOI 10.2166/wst.2006.585##Brugnach M., 2008, RELATIONAL CONCEPT U##Butler D., 2011, URBAN DRAINAGE##Center for Neighborhood Technology, 2011, WATER##Chocat B, 2007, INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON, V16, P273, DOI 10.1177/1420326X07078854##Cook EA, 2007, J GREEN BUILD, V2, P46, DOI 10.3992/jgb.2.4.46##Dapolito Dunn A., 2007, GREEN LIGHT GREEN IN##Donnelly R, 2006, J ENVIRON ENG, V132, P149, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2006)132:2(149)##Elvingson P., 2011, HALLBAR UTVECKLING##Faram MG, 2010, P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU, V163, P107, DOI 10.1680/ensu.2010.163.2.107##Farrelly M, 2011, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V21, P721, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.007##Farrelly M., 2008, 11 INT C URB DRAIN A##Foxon TJ, 2002, J ENVIRON PLANN MAN, V45, P285, DOI DOI 10.1080/09640560220116341##Fraser EDG, 2006, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V78, P114, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2005.04.009##Harremoes P, 1997, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V35, P11, DOI 10.1016/S0273-1223(97)00180-7##Harremoes P, 2002, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V45, P1, DOI 10.2166/wst.2002.0041##Hellstrom D, 2000, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, V20, P311, DOI 10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00043-3##HOLMBERG J, 1995, THESIS CHALMERS U TE##HUGHES TP, 1986, SOC STUD SCI, V16, P281, DOI 10.1177/0306312786016002004##Hurley A.L., 2006, P 7 INT C URB DRAIN, V2, P609##Hurley L, 2008, P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU, V161, P23, DOI 10.1680/ensu.2008.161.1.23##Kain J.-H., 2003, MIKA METHODOLOGIES I, V15, P9##Kain JHK, 2007, P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU, V160, P87, DOI DOI 10.1680/ENSU.2007.160.2.87##Kates RW, 2005, ENVIRONMENT, V47, P8##Kemp R., 2007, Sustainability: Science, Practice & Policy, V3, P5##Larsen TA, 1997, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V35, P3, DOI 10.1016/S0273-1223(97)00179-0##Laws D, 2011, P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU, V164, P25, DOI 10.1680/ensu.2011.164.1.25##Malmqvist P. - A, 2006, STRATEGIC PLANNING S##Marsalek J, 2002, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V46, P1##Milman A, 2008, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V18, P758, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.08.002##Natural Resources Defence Council, 2011, ROOFT RIV 2##Niemczynowicz J., 1999, Urban Water, V1, P1, DOI 10.1016/S1462-0758(99)00009-6##NIEMCZYNOWICZ J, 1994, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V30, P269##Palme U., 2007, J CLEAN PROD, V16, P1346##Palme U, 2009, WATER POLICY, V11, P250, DOI 10.2166/wp.2009.013##Palmer R, 2000, ENVIRON VALUE, V9, P411, DOI 10.3197/096327100129342128##Roy AH, 2008, ENVIRON MANAGE, V42, P344, DOI 10.1007/s00267-008-9119-1##SEPA, 2011, MILJ##Smith A, 2005, RES POLICY, V34, P1491, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2005.07.005##SNBH, 2011, SNBH PUBL, V2011-11##SNBH, 2004, HALLB STAD TAT SVER##Spatari S, 2011, ENVIRON POLLUT, V159, P2174, DOI 10.1016/j.envpol.2011.01.015##Stahre P., 2008, BLUE GREEN FINGERPRI##Stahre P., 2003, NEW APPROACH SUSTAIN##Starkl M, 2004, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V71, P245, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.03.004##Sundberg C., 2004, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, V6, P120, DOI 10.1007/S10098-003-0227-6##SWWA, 2000, SWED WAT WAST ASS FA##The Natural Step, 2012, OUR STOR##The Swedish Government, 2011, SWED STRAT SUST DEV##The Swedish Government, 2011, SWED ENV COD##TISSUE, 2005, RES REPORT##Trost J., 2005, KVALITATIVA INTERVJU##UNITRACC, 2011, NORIS PROJ TOP COT L##van Roon M, 2007, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V83, P437, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2006.04.008##Wong S, 2009, ENVIRON POLIT, V18, P37, DOI 10.1080/09644010802624785##Wong THF, 2009, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V60, P673, DOI 10.2166/wst.2009.436##World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##Yin R.K., 2003, CASE STUDY RES DESIG, V5",37,"2021-09-03","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: researchfish","COM5","no","SDG.12#SDG.9"

This situation is associated with the fact that nowadays the biggest influence on the functioning of the global ecosystem is by man himself, who exists simultaneously in two environments: social and cultural. According to the author, all crises are global and furthermore embrace both environments in which man functions. Therefore, people are most at risk to pay for every crisis, including the ecological one. Human communities would be able to function in any environment, if they accept and implement sustainable development, which includes the functioning of the anthroposphere and the biosphere at the same time. Communities which were unable to do so, collapsed and even disappeared. In conclusion, the author claims that even today there is such a requirement. Today's advocated sustainable development ensues from our species' historical experiences.

"J","WOS:000331452200004",2014,"Corporate Reports on Sustainability and Sustainable Development: 'We Have Arrived'","This paper analyses how the world's largest corporations communicate about sustainability and sustainable development in their non-financial reports. It investigates the concept use, definitions and attempts at operationalization, and the rationales that corporations give to engage with them. It is concluded that the corporations typically opt to treat sustainability and sustainable development as given and unproblematic instead of addressing the fundamental problems of today's practice or the dilemmas of the concepts. The most striking finding, however, is that so many of the corporations no longer argue that they are on a 'journey' towards sustainability, but that they have already integrated sustainability principles and that they have worked like this for years. Such arguments arguably inhibit the change in business models that many commentators call for.

The trade literature shows that newly industrializing countries are benefitting from international trade for export-led growth. However, the least developed countries with limited access to international trade networks do not participate in the new global production networks. The World Trade Organization/General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change regimes do not have the development of more sustainable transport systems as a priority. In this sense, international transport remains on the fringes of the environment and development policy fields. Three transition pathways to SD have been developed: (a) information and telecommunications technologies leading to particip.ation of least developed countries in global production networks, (b) changes in social preferences toward a high priority for the environment, leading to an extensive growth in fair-trade networks and sustainable production and consumption, and (c) SD from economic growth in newly industrializing countries, with an increased priority placed on solving environmental problems.","CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; FREIGHT TRANSPORT; LOGISTICS; EMISSIONS; BIOFUELS; TOURISM; TRADE; PERSPECTIVES; AQUACULTURE","transport; sustainable development; transitions; shipping; aviation","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT","Kohler, J","Fraunhofer Inst System & Innovat Forsch ISI, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.","Development Studies; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration","African Manager, 2011, AFRICAN MANAGER 1007##Aguilera A, 2008, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V42, P1109, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2008.03.005##Alam Shawkat., 2008, SUSTAINABLE DEV FREE##Anderson WP, 2007, TRANSP ECON MANAG PO, P167##Anger A, 2010, TRANSPORT POLICY, V17, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2009.10.010##[Anonymous], 2011, NAV ARCHIT, P44##[Anonymous], 2010, ENGINEER##ARCHIBUGIE D, 1997, TECHNOLOGY GLOBALISA##Ashworth K, 2013, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V3, P492, DOI [10.1038/NCLIMATE1788, 10.1038/nclimate1788]##Bachle P., 2009, THESIS KIT FRAUNHOFE##Bergman N, 2008, JASSS-J ARTIF SOC S, V11##Borghesi S, 2003, ECOL ECON, V44, P77, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00222-7##Brown GW, 2008, POLIT STUD REV, V6, P42, DOI 10.1111/j.1478-9299.2007.00144.x##Brundtland Commission, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##Buhaug O., 2009, 2 IMO GHG STUDY 2009##Button K., 2008, IMPACT GLOBALISATION##Capineri C, 2007, TRANSP ECON MANAG PO, P259##Charles MB, 2007, FUTURES, V39, P1009, DOI 10.1016/j.futures.2007.03.017##Cornelissen S, 2012, BIOMASS BIOENERG, V41, P21, DOI 10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.12.049##Daley B, 2009, SUSTAIN DEV, V17, P210, DOI 10.1002/sd.383##Daly H.

"J","WOS:000333505400010",2014,"Education for sustainable development: Implications for small island developing states (SIDS)","Climate change and global recession have especially dramatic implications for small island developing states (SIDS). It is argued that such issues warrant urgent attention from researchers, policy-makers and the international development community. The existing literature relating to sustainable development in SIDS is limited in scope and rarely addresses the educational implications of sustainable development in significant depth. This paper draws upon recent theoretically and empirically grounded research carried out in collaboration with colleagues working within small states worldwide. The analysis examines how SIDS are responding to these contemporary global challenges, how the international community is engaging with such developments, and how education research and development cooperation might play more effective roles in advancing sustainable development in small state contexts. The paper concludes by exploring ways in which the wider international community may learn from the small states experience.

"J","WOS:000334158400003",2014,"Sustainable development and institutional boundaries","The boundaries between the institutional domains of state, market, and science, appear to obstruct the effective management of sustainability problems: public and private interests, as well as supply and demand of knowledge, are often not aligned in cases of sustainable development. This suggests that in order to pursue sustainability, we have to establish effective modes of transcending boundaries between institutional domains. Then again, transcending institutional boundaries might lead to other problems, because if we look at the origins of these institutional domains, it appears that they have been designed to solve certain societal problems, while allowing to hold actors accountable for their actions and decisions. Mixing up institutional domains might lead to conflicting accountability claims. Given potential accountability issues, the pursuit of sustainability should besides targeting effectiveness, also take account of issues of legitimacy.

"J","WOS:000334505000006",2014,"Reinterpreting the Definition of Sustainable Development for a More Ecocentric Reorientation","While environmental and social research have generated a large amount of information and data on how values and environmental ethics relate to sustainable development, there are no studies that examine the missing links reflected in the terminology of the sustainable development definition that alienates it from its ecological ethos. This paper reviews the concept of sustainable development that continues to remain vague even two decades after the Brundtland Commission report. It then examines the limitations in the contemporary anthropocentric conceptualization of sustainable development with a utilitarian ethic and argues for a more ecocentric reinterpretation of its definition that is more inclusive and incorporates recognition of the socio-ecological values. The paper concludes with a call for a revised global resolution and a framework for sustainable development based on its reinterpretation that recognizes the interdependence of humans with the rest of the ecosphere.

It turns out that marketization, government governance, and legal environment play significant roles in promoting sustainable economic development. Further tests show that the results of Eastern China are consistent with China's inter-provincial results; while in Western China, the promotion effect of marketization, government governance, and legal environment on sustainable economic development is not significant.","GROWTH; INSTITUTIONS; DEMOCRACY; PANEL; CHINA; RULE","government governance; legal environment; sustainable economic development","SUSTAINABILITY","Wei, F##Kong, Y","[Wei, Feng] Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000336881100023",2014,"Towards achieving energy for sustainable development in Nigeria","The importance of energy availability in the economic growth, social and political development of every nation cannot be overemphasized. Affordable and reliable energy. availability is the precondition for sustainable development. Sustainable development calls for an efficient, reliable and decentralized energy economy, based on local and clean energy sources, in which the price paid by the consumer will reflect the real cost of energy products to the economy. There is clear evidence that Nigeria is blessed with abundant resources of fossil fuels as well as renewable energy resources. The major challenge is inefficient utilization of energy in the country. There is no doubt that the present power crisis afflicting Nigeria will persist unless the government diversifies her energy sources and adopt new available technologies to reduce energy wastages and save cost. This study examines the perspective of energy efficiency and renewable energy in the making of strategies for a sustainable development in Nigeria. Such strategies involve energy savings on the demand side, efficiency improvements in the energy production, and replacement of fossil fuels by various sources of renewable energy. Factors that need to be considered in the shift to its sustainable energy future are examined in this article. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Insofar as education for sustainable development is directed at securing the future of human well-being, this article suggests that it concerns a moral discourse where notions about what may or may not happen in the future plays an important role in the governance of practices and behaviors in the present. Since the future is shrouded in uncertainty, it is suggested that the emotions of hope and fear may be understood in terms of tools for governing the everyday lives of children, invoking alluring and deterrent images that influence their decision-making. Besides seeking to gain a better understanding of some of the preconditions of education for sustainable development, the aim of this article concerns an investigation into some of the effects that education for sustainable development may have on the lives of children. To this end, it looks at how hope and fear are being put into play within the discourse as strategies for governing individuals in relation to the uncertainty of the future.",NA,"education for sustainable development; fear; future; governance; hope","CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION","Dahlbeck, J","Malmo Univ, Fac Educ & Soc, Malmo, Sweden.","Education & Educational Research","Education & Educational Research","[Anonymous], 2007, RADICAL PHILOS REV, V10, P157##Boler M., 1997, EDUC THEORY, V47, P203, DOI DOI 10.1111/EDTH.1997.47.ISSUE-2##Burchell, 2007, SECURITY TERRITORY P##Dahlbeck J., 2012, THESIS MALMO U MALMO##Dahlbeck J, 2012, DISCOURSE-ABINGDON, V33, P267, DOI 10.1080/01596306.2012.666080##DAY JP, 1970, MIND, V79, P369##Foucault M., 1977, LANGUAGE COUNTERMEMO##Foucault M, 1981, UNTYING TEXT POSTSTR##Hultqvist K., 2006, FUTURE IS NOT WHAT I, P20##Lauder H., 2006, ED GLOBALIZATION SOC, P1##Massumi B., 2007, THEORY EVENT, V10##McManus S., 2011, THEORY EVENT, V14##Minton A., 2009, FEAR HAPPINESS 21 CE##Nadler S, 2011, BOOK FORGED IN HELL: SPINOZA'S SCANDALOUS TREATISE AND THE BIRTH OF THE SECULAR AGE, P1##Nadler S, 2006, CAMB INTROD KEY PHIL, P1, DOI 10.2277/ 0521544793##Nietzsche Friedrich, 1994, HUMAN ALL TOO HUMAN##Nietzsche Friedrich, 2008, GOOD EVIL PRELUDE PH##Nietzsche Friedrich Wilhelm, 1974, GAY SCI PRELUDE RHYM##Nunn BV, 2005, INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES ON HOPE, P63##Petri L., 2008, MOFFLOR MANNISKOR ST##Popkewitz T., 2008, COSMOPOLITANISM AGE##Rose N., 1999, POWERS FREEDOM REFRA##Seneca L.A., 1793, SENECAS MORALS, P89##Seneca Lucius Annaeus, 1969, LETT STOIC##Smith Daniel W., 2007, PARRHESIA, V2, P66, DOI DOI 10.3366/EDINBURGH/9780748641178.003.0008##Spinoza, 2007, THEOLOGICAL POLITICA##Spinoza B., 1996, ETHICS##Strong T.B., 1999, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE##World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##Zembylas M., 2007, 5 PEDAGOGIES 1000 PO",8,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM5","no","SDG.12#SDG.4"

Rather, the concept's use has increasingly reflected socially desirable attributes of solutions to local- and project-level problems, but these ignore the global challenges that the concept was meant to address. We return to the original definition of sustainable development used in the Brundtland Report and suggest an assessment method to determine whether countries currently meet the threshold values of four equally important primary dimensions: safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability, satisfying basic needs, and promoting intragenerational and intergenerational equity. We also define indicators and threshold values for each of these dimensions; in addition, we show how 167 countries compare in meeting these threshold values. Currently, no country meets all four thresholds. Even so, we propose that, with the use of technology and behavioural changes, it will be possible to reach the threshold values by 2030.

This paper investigates the relationship among current consumption, sacrifice and sustainability improvement in a general context and in two canonical, stylized economies. We argue that the maximin value of utility measures what is sustainable and provides the limit to growth. Maximin value is interpreted as a dynamic environmental-economic carrying capacity and current utility as an environmental-economic footprint. The time derivative of maximin value is interpreted as net investment in sustainability improvement. It is called durable savings to distinguish it from genuine savings, usually computed with discounted-utilitarian prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As the foundation of such analysis, the authors adopted the category of values, which constitutes on the one hand ethical reflection accompanying human activities connected with sustainable development, and on the other explains the nature of market behaviour of the modern consumer. In the search for the mechanism disturbing sustainable development, the authors pointed to the phenomenon of degradation of household as the most important component of the socio-economic system. Such degradation occurs under pressure from the market powered by innovation, the enterprise exposed to fierce competition and the state which supports in its policy the concentration of capital and unbalanced consumption. It has been proved that the processes which shorten the market life cycle of goods and reduce the contemporary human, market participant, to the role of an unreflective consumer, are in conflict with the principles of sustainable development. Modern marketing can be oriented to the realization of the principles of sustainable development, introducing the paradigm of ecologisation into the theory and practice of marketing activity with reference to the model of managing a modern enterprise as well as to the process of revision in consumers' consciousness and attitudes, gradually turning them into eco-consumers.",NA,"sustainable development; marketing; consumer; ecologisation","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Skowron, S##Szymoniuk, B","[Skowron, Stanislaw; Szymoniuk, Barbara] Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Management, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Borys T., 2005, WSKAZNIKI ZROWNOWAZO##Brillman J., 2002, NOWOCZESNE KONCEPCJE##BRUNNHUBER S., LECT SEM FAC ENV ENG##Castells M., 2008, SPOLECZENSTWO SIECI##Christensen C.

The local level's primacy in terms of introducing the principles of sustainability is openly stipulated by Agenda 21, thus providing the impetus for local sustainable development strategies Local Agenda 21. These community-specific, long-term visions of sustainable co-existence serve, as an important strategic tool for overcoming challenges communities may face while maintaining the general idea of the future. As prime standardised artifacts, local sustainable development strategies represent an excellent insight into the capacity of an individual community to achieve a sustainable future and deal with potential challenges. In this paper, we analysed four such visions of a sustainable future for two city and two minor Slovenian municipalities in order to examine their capacity to develop into sustainable communities. By employing George and Kirkpatrick's (2006) framework for assessing sustainable development strategies, we identified useful and problematic aspects of the documents prepared by the city and town municipalities. The analysis showed that the transition period in Slovenia has left a significant impact on development planning and its consequences have yet to be fully resolved.",NA,"local sustainable development strategy; sustainability assessment; sustainable development; Local Agenda 21; Slovenia","LEX LOCALIS-JOURNAL OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT","Dezelan, T##Maksuti, A##Ursic, M","[Dezelan, Tomaz; Maksuti, Alem; Ursic, Matjaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.","Political Science; Public Administration","Government & Law; Public Administration","Albrechts L, 2004, ENVIRON PLANN B, V31, P743, DOI 10.1068/b3065##Albrechts L., 1999, EUROPEAN PLANNING ST, V7, P587, DOI DOI 10.1080/09654319908720540##Albrechts L, 2006, EUR PLAN STUD, V14, P1487, DOI 10.1080/09654310600852464##[Anonymous], 1992, AG 21##ARNSTEIN SR, 1969, J AM I PLANNERS, V35, P216, DOI 10.1080/01944366908977225##Baker S., 2005, POLITICS SUSTAINABLE##Blatnik A., 2004, TRAJNOSTNI RAZVOJ ST##Blewitt J, 2008, UNDERSTANDING SUSTAI##Brugmann J, 1996, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, V9255, P363, DOI 10.1016/S0195-9255(97)81658-7##Ciegis R, 2008, TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO, V14, P107, DOI 10.3846/1392-8619.2008.14.107-117##Cus F., 1994, EXP WORKSH REG TECN, P145##Dalal-Clyton B., 2002, SUSTAINABLE DEV STRA##Dezelan T., 2010, OPEN METHOD COORDINA, P75##*EUR COMM, 2004, NAT SUST DEV STRAT E##European Commission, 2010, LAT NEWS WEBS SUST D##European Commission, 2010, IMPL REN EU SUST DEV##Faulkner B., 1997, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, V5, P3, DOI 10.1080/09669589708667273##George C, 2006, NAT RESOUR FORUM, V30, P146, DOI 10.1111/j.1477-8947.2006.00167.x##Gibson Robert B., 2006, Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy and Management, V8, P259, DOI 10.1142/S1464333206002517##GOLDIN I., 1995, EC SUSTAINABLE DEV##Hall P.

Even extractive industries' activities, traditionally considered as both environmentally and socially harmful, have endorsed the sustainable development idea. We discuss the reasons why the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project, which aimed at being a model' project, did not meet the expectations in terms of sustainable development, putting the emphasis on its social dimension. Focusing on the World Bank, which played a key role in the implementation of the project, we critically examine the adoption of preventive measures, the identification of vulnerable populations and the level of participation of local populations. We argue that economic objectives still prevail over other considerations, and we question the very nature of the project as a (sustainable) development project.

"J","WOS:000341639200005",2014,"Sustainable Development Planning: A Case of Public Participation using Online Forums","Public participation in Sustainable Development Planning (SDP) of cities represents significant challenges to governments and private organizations responsible for developing infrastructure. In this study, a regional government used a series of electronic discussion papers and questions to enable online forum discussions and exchanges between 196 participants on the major SDP issues related to city development up to 2030. This study used a rigorous and structured QSR nvivo analysis of 690 online forum postings to determine the participants' major SDP concerns for the city over a 20-year period. The collective results of the investigation show that future integrated transport networks, higher density residential and commercial land use, and sustainable population growth are still the subject of concern and intense debate among forum participants, SDP experts and the government. The research also demonstrates the capacity of green information and technology systems to serve as important mechanisms for SDP participation and consultation.

We demonstrate that sustainability assessment and sustainability indicators can be powerful decision-supporting tools that foster sustainable development by addressing three sustainability decision-making challenges: interpretation, information-structuring, and influence. Particularly, since the 1990s many substantial and often promising sustainability assessment and sustainability indicators efforts are made. However, better practices and a broader shared understanding are still required. We aim to contribute to that objective by adopting a theoretical perspective that frames SA and SI in the context of sustainable development as a decision-making strategy and that introduces both fields along several essential aspects in a structured and comparable manner.","IMPACT ASSESSMENT; POLICY; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; TARGETS; BOTTOM; ISSUES; GOALS","sustainability assessment; sustainability indicators; decision-making; impact assessment; sustainable development","SUSTAINABILITY","Waas, T##Huge, J##Block, T##Wright, T##Benitez-Capistros, F##Verbruggen, A","[Waas, Tom; Huge, Jean; Block, Thomas] Univ Ghent, Ctr Sustainable Dev, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.

Exploring late-modern identity and sustainable development","The idea of individualisation is powerful: in late-modern society, people's sense of identity is based on their individual experience rather than their relationships with others. This is problematic for sustainable development because it conflicts with the ideal of participation enshrined in its theory and practice. It is also unclear how the idea plays out in this field, with emerging evidence that some sustainable development policy and practice is individualising. The realities of individualisation are more complex. Empirical studies outside sustainable development have shown that individualising policy does not necessarily have individualising effects. Considering how the idea and realities of individualisation cast new light on subjectivities imagined in sustainable development theory and practice, I argue that sustainable development scholars and practitioners need to consider a range of late-modern subjectivities, and be critically aware of how individualisation is potentially reproduced in policy and practice.","LIFE-STYLES; COMMUNITY; CONSUMPTION; CRITIQUE; GREEN","participation; individualisation; late-modern identity; sustainable development; sustainable consumption","ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS","Middlemiss, L","Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.","Environmental Studies; Political Science","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law","Atkinson W, 2010, IDENTITY STUD SOC SC, P1, DOI 10.1057/9780230290655##Atkinson W, 2008, SOCIOL REV, V56, P1, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-954X.2008.00774.x##Atkinson W, 2007, BRIT J SOCIOL, V58, P349, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2007.00155.x##Barnett Clive, 2010, GLOBALIZING RESPONSI##Bauman Z., 2007, CONSUMING LIFE##Bauman Zygmunt, 2000, LIQUID MODERNITY##Bauman Zygmunt., 2002, INDIVIDUALIZATION I##Beck U., 1992, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI##Beck-Gernsheim Elisabeth., 2002, INDIVIDUALIZATION I##Bluhdorn I, 2013, ENVIRON POLIT, V22, P16, DOI 10.1080/09644016.2013.755005##Bluhdorn I., 2006, EUR J SOC THEORY, V9, P23, DOI DOI 10.1177/1368431006060461##Campbell C., 2004, ELUSIVE CONSUMPTION, P27##Castree N, 2008, ENVIRON PLANN A, V40, P131, DOI 10.1068/a3999##Charles N., 2008, FAMILIES TRANSITION##Cohen M.

After briefly reviewing the concept of sustainable development and its interpretations, national sustainable development discourses are analysed in the context of the wider political discourses that have arisen around the political ideologies of neo-liberalism, Thatcherism and New Labour. A critical discourse analysis, using the concept of discursive techniques', reveals the way in which the concept of sustainable development has been adapted to conform to the dominant political discourses of neo-liberalism, Thatcherism and New Labour. In this process, the term has been used to emphasize the compatibility of economic growth and environmental protection, and hence, arguably, has been used to avoid rather than to facilitate radical action.

Within the environment are resources that are needed for the survival of society. As resources are largely limited and finite, humans as agents of change must employ techniques that allow an efficient and lasting use of the available resources in their environment.

"J","WOS:000346461000026",2014,"Technology complexity, technology transfer mechanisms and sustainable development","Merging climate change mitigation and sustainable development in developing countries is pivotal for the transition towards low carbon growth pathways. This paper combines the field of technology transfer and technology-specific aspects with sustainable development objectives. The general climate change mitigation paradigm has shifted from project oriented mitigation action to more strategic, country-wide, cross-sectoral mitigation plans, in order to explicitly take into account also economic development goals. Local technology needs and socio-technical circumstances are important towards economic development induced by technology transfer. Yet, this approach is not sufficient for the success of technology transfer, which shall also deliver on economic development. A strategy for the adoption of technologies, as well as the broadening of the domestic technology manufacturing base, needs to consider also the technology properties itself in greater detail. The technology transfer process should emphasize the economic developmental purpose as well as the properties of technologies. Thus, I propose a detailed assessment of the technology and its potential of being adopted by suggesting that technology complexity assessments should be integrated into technology transfer mechanisms. By using CSP, PV and wind technology as examples, I describe how the evaluation of technology complexity and of potential economic development, determined by demand for manufactured goods and services within domestic economies, which could lead to job creation and value added, could be used to inform policy makers.

In this study, we analysed the collective views of 226 individuals and public and private organizations to determine SD pathways for cities. Our analysis of 1712 stakeholder statements showed that deficiencies in infrastructure investment, climate change resistant and environmentally harmonized developments, integrated transport networks, land use patterns and SD governance present ongoing challenges and opportunities for governments and communities. Critically, our analysis suggests that an estimated A$400-755 billion infrastructure underinvestment over past economic cycles, tight financial conditions and noted shortcomings in multi-level SD governance will likely see pathway realizations delayed by several years into the future.

Research now indicates that humanity's impact on Earth's life support system is so great that further global environmental change risks undermining long-term prosperity and poverty eradication goals. Socioeconomic development and global sustainability are often posed as being in conflict because of tradeoffs between a growing world population, as well as higher standards of living, and managing the effects of production and consumption on the global environment. We have established a framework for an evidence-based architecture for new goals and targets. Building on six SDGs, which integrate development and environmental considerations, we developed a comprehensive framework of goals and associated targets, which demonstrate that it is possible, and necessary, to develop integrated targets relating to food, energy, water, and ecosystem services goals; thus providing a neutral evidence-based approach to support SDG target discussions. Global analyses, using an integrated global target equation, are close to providing indicators for these targets. Alongside development-only targets and environment-only targets, these integrated targets would ensure that synergies are maximized and trade-offs are managed in the implementation of SDGs.","FOOD SECURITY; PLANETARY STEWARDSHIP; ANTHROPOCENE; AGRICULTURE; BOUNDARIES; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGE; HUMANITY; SCIENCE; PEOPLE","development; environment; sustainability; sustainable development; sustainable development goals","ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY","Griggs, D##Smith, MS##Rockstrom, J##Ohman, MC##Gaffney, O##Glaser, G##Kanie, N##Noble, I##Steffen, W##Shyamsundar, P","[Griggs, David; Noble, Ian] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainabil Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.

Eurostat produce a monitoring report every two years based on the EU set of sustainable development indicators (SDIs). The main objective of this paper is to create an aggregated index of the sustainable development from EU set of SDIs for each 27 EU country based on the PCA. The headline indicator economic growth was not involved because its increase is not expressly followed by positive change in other SDIs from social, economic and environmental fields. The aggregated SD index enables to get an overall picture about the position of each of the 27 EU countries and its development in terms of the sustainability over time as assumed in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. Sweden, Denmark, Netherland, and Great Britain have repeatedly reached the highest value of aggregated SD index. The highest positive change in the aggregated SD index has occurred in countries with the lowest value of aggregated SD index. Moreover, we put this new aggregated index in relation with economic growth and found that there is a negative correlation between aggregated SD index and the economic growth for most of the 27 EU countries.

This study conducts a systematic survey of research publications in the fields of ergonomics and sustainable development over the past two decades (1992-2011), in order to identify their research trends and convergent areas where ergonomics can play an important role in sustainable development. The results show that 'methods and techniques', 'human characteristics', 'work design and organization', 'health and safety' and 'workplace and equipment design' are the top five frequently researched areas in ergonomics. Ergonomics has an opportunity to contribute its knowledge especially to 'industrial and product design', 'architecture', 'health and safety' and 'NCI' (especially for energy reduction issues) categories of sustainable development. Typical methodologies and general guidance on how to contribute the expertise of ergonomist to sustainable development are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper initially presents an analysis of past developments, complemented by an assessment of the emphasis on sustainable development by the International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education. In particular, it makes cross-references to the deliberations held at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, with a special emphasis to the document ""The Future we Want"". It concludes by listing a set of suggestions and measures that both industrialised and developing countries may consider to translate the principles of sustainable development into reality. Findings - Sustainable development is and will continue to be a matter of substantial international interest and concern. The developments achieved over the past 20 years have been substantial, but there are still many gaps and need which need to be met, so as to improve its prospects in the next two decades. Originality/value - The paper provides useful insights which allow a better understanding of the role of universities in fostering sustainable development, and some of the key issues need to be considered, so as to allow things to move in the right direction.",NA,"Sustainability; Education for sustainable development; Higher education; Sustainable development; Post Rio+20; Rio+20","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Leal, W##Manolas, E##Pace, P","[Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.

"J","WOS:000351058100003",2015,"Political modernisation for ecologically sustainable development in Australia","This article considers Australia's ecologically sustainable development (ESD) trajectory through the prism of ecological modernisation (EM). As a 'meta policy' ESD offered the important animating principles and wide-ranging objectives of environmental reform, with the operational specifics provided by EM theory and practice. EM proposes two key interrelated strategies for achieving sustainable development: the modernisation of production and its practices and the modernisation of the political sector and its institutions. This article focuses on the latter, particularly on the political commitment to ESD at the political elite level. In considering key moments in Australia's political modernisation story, the article finds that, despite important developments and innovations, the ESD and EM experiment in Australia has had limited success in significantly and permanently shifting the government business relations of sustainability in ways that would respect the spirit and goals of ESD. This can in part be explained by the limited capacity of a reform process such as EM to shift the political dynamics of ESD's environment-development relationship.","CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY; SOCIOLOGY","environmental political leadership; ecologically sustainable development; sustainable development; ecological modernisation; environmental institutions","AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","Curran, G","Griffith Univ, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ABC, 2000, GREENH STRAT SPLITS##Arts B, 2004, POLICY SCI, V37, P339, DOI 10.1007/s11077-005-0156-9##Bailey I, 2011, ANTIPODE, V43, P682, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2011.00880.x##Bean C, 1990, GREENING AUSTR POLIT##Bluhdorn I, 2007, ENVIRON POLIT, V16, P251, DOI 10.1080/09644010701211759##Buttel FH, 2003, ORGAN ENVIRON, V16, P306, DOI 10.1177/1086026603256279##Buttel FH, 2000, GEOFORUM, V31, P57, DOI 10.1016/S0016-7185(99)00044-5##Christoff P, 2005, GLOB CHANG PEACE SEC, V17, P29, DOI 10.1080/0951274052000319346##Collins S-J, 2012, HOCK AND ORE##Crowley K, 2002, GOVT POLITICS POWER, P483##CURRAN G, 2002, AUSTR J ENV MANAGEME, V9, P158, DOI DOI 10.1080/14486563.2002.10648556##Curran G, 2011, ENVIRON PLANN C, V29, P1004, DOI 10.1068/c10217##Curran G, 2009, ENVIRON POLIT, V18, P201, DOI 10.1080/09644010802682569##Doyle T., 1995, ENV POLITICS POLICY##Dryzek JS, 2002, POLIT STUD-LONDON, V50, P659, DOI 10.1111/1467-9248.00001##Eckersley R, 1996, THE STATE QUESTION, P74##Economou N, 1999, AUSTR ENV POLICY, V2, P65##ECONOMOU N, 2004, POLITICS AUSTR SOC P, P357##Hajer M.A., 1995, POLITICS ENV DISCOUR##Harris S.

"J","WOS:000351963400001",2015,"Sustainable development outcomes of coal mine methane clean development mechanism Projects in China","Since the establishment of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) there has been ongoing discussion about its potential and actual effectiveness in assisting in reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. Projects implemented in non-Annex 1 countries have had the aim to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases and also to contribute to sustainable development. In China, a significant number of CDM projects have been implemented across a range of sectors of the economy. Although various evaluations have been made of Chinese CDM projects, one industrial sector that has received little attention has been mining. In particular, the sustainable development outcomes of Chinese CDM projects associated with methane capture and utilisation from coal mines have not been evaluated. This research has involved review and assessment of 30 Chinese coal mine methane CDM projects. The evaluation approach involved content analysis of coal mine methane CDM project documents in relation to quantitative reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and indicators of contributions to sustainable development. The sustainability indicators found to be most prevalent were safety, energy use, technology transfer and employment. Also a comparison of outcomes was made with six coal mine projects initiated under the CDM in other developing countries. Overall, it was found that only brief accounts of sustainable development goals are given in CDM documents for coal mine methane project activities and that these are arguably insufficient in detail. Although varying types of sustainability initiatives were identified, many potential areas were not.

Indeed, post Keynesian sustainable development can be close to Ignacy Sachs's eco-development, which is inspired by Michal Kalecki. Thus, post Keynesianism and eco-development share the same position related to economic growth. They meet, via the concept of radical uncertainty, on the importance of the precautionary principle.

"J","WOS:000353483700021",2015,"HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT OF MARKETING SUSTAINABILITY IN THE PROCESS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","One of the changes in marketing refers to the redirection of focus from profit to sustainable development. Sustainability marketing can influence sustainable development. The key contribution of the paper is the presentation of holistic approach to sustainable development and sustainability marketing through three dimensions: goals, actors and capital. Holistic management of sustainability marketing in the process of sustainable development is focused on economic, environmental and social issues of sustainability; the integrated engagement of key actors - national and local governments, organizations and population; and capital - human, natural, institutional and infrastructure, financial and technological. Additional contribution of the paper is the presentation of key actors' activities. Governments set laws, regulations and standards of socially responsible behaviour. Organizations can implement sustainability marketing. The characteristics of traditional, environmental, societal and sustainability marketing have been presented in this paper. Another contribution of the paper is its focus on sustainability marketing and the presentation of sustainability marketing mix as the integration of 4Ps (sustainable products/services, price, place and promotion) and 4Cs (customer solutions, customer cost, convenience and communication). Organizations can influence sustainable development by the creation and delivery of sustainability marketing mix. The task of each profit organization is to deliver sustainable value to consumer gaining profit, i.e. besides economic, it is essential to achieve environmental and social goals. The importance of human capital has been highlighted. Additional contribution of the paper is the presentation of the threefold social responsibility of an individual employee.","SUPPLY CHAIN; SOCIAL MEDIA; GREEN; ORIENTATION; EVOLUTION; BUSINESS; ATTITUDE; STRATEGY; COUNTRY; FIRMS","holistic management; sustainable development; sustainability marketing","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL","Rakic, B##Rakic, M","[Rakic, Beba; Rakic, Mira] Megatrend Univ, Grad Sch Business Studies, Goce Delceva 8, Belgrade 11070, Serbia.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Ahi P., 2014, APPL MATH MODELLING##Bansal P, 2002, ACAD MANAGE EXEC, V16, P122, DOI 10.5465/AME.2002.7173572##Belz F.M., 2008, SYSTEM INNOVATION SU, P114##Belz FM, 2010, BUS STRATEG ENVIRON, V19, P401, DOI 10.1002/bse.649##Bourlakis M, 2014, IND MARKET MANAG, V43, P56, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.002##Brindley C, 2014, IND MARKET MANAG, V43, P45, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.003##Cordente-Rodriguez M, 2014, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V13, P2437, DOI 10.30638/eemj.2014.273##Czinkota M, 2014, IND MARKET MANAG, V43, P91, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.10.005##Dam K.Y., 1996, J MACROMARKETING, V16, P45, DOI DOI 10.1177/027614679601600204##Das Gandhi NM, 2006, MANAG ENVIRON QUAL, V17, P654, DOI 10.1108/14777830610702502##Del Chiappa G, 2014, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V13, P2449##Dragomir VD, 2008, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V7, P427##Gavrilescu M, 2008, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V7, P617##Gordon R, 2011, MARKETING THEOR, V11, P143, DOI 10.1177/1470593111403218##Grecu E, 2014, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V13, P1873##Gupta S, 2013, J WORLD BUS, V48, P287, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2012.07.013##Hancock L, 2014, J CLEAN PROD, V62, P62, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.07.062##Hartmann P, 2005, MARK INTELL PLAN, V23, P9, DOI 10.1108/02634500510577447##Hopwood B, 2005, SUSTAIN DEV, V13, P38, DOI 10.1002/sd.244##Huesemann Michael H., 2008, Environment Development and Sustainability, V10, P787, DOI 10.1007/s10668-007-9085-4##Huisingh D, 2007, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V6, P357##Hunt SD, 2012, J MACROMARKETING, V32, P404, DOI 10.1177/0276146712453331##Jankowska MA, 2014, J ACAD LIBR, V40, P45, DOI 10.1016/j.acalib.2013.10.013##Jayanti RK, 2014, IIMB MANAG REV, V26, P130, DOI 10.1016/j.iimb.2014.03.004##Saez-Martinez FJ, 2014, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V13, P2541##Kumar V, 2014, IND MARKET MANAG, V43, P6, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.06.008##Kumar V, 2013, GLOB BUS REV, V14, P601, DOI 10.1177/0972150913501598##Kumar V, 2012, PROCD SOC BEHV, V37, P482, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.03.313##Lehner M., 2014, J CLEANER PRODUCTION##Leonidou CN, 2013, J ACAD MARKET SCI, V41, P151, DOI 10.1007/s11747-012-0317-2##Liu SF, 2012, IND MARKET MANAG, V41, P581, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2012.04.005##Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Serbia, 2007, LOC ENV ACT PLAN LEA##Minton E, 2012, J ADVERTISING, V41, P69, DOI 10.1080/00913367.2012.10672458##Panainte M, 2014, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V13, P1665, DOI 10.30638/eemj.2014.184##Peattie K., 2010, MARKETING REV ST GAL, V1, P5##Peattie K., 2009, SUSTAINABILITY MARKE##Peattie Ken, 2001, MARKETING REV, V2, P129, DOI DOI 10.1362/1469347012569869##Peiro-Signes A, 2013, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V12, P1933##Peterson M., 2012, SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRI##Reilly AH, 2014, BUS HORIZONS, V57, P747, DOI 10.1016/j.bushor.2014.07.008##Reinert E., 2006, RICH COUNTRIES GOT R##Rojsek I, 2001, J BUS ETHICS, V33, P37, DOI 10.1023/A:1011977116496##Sadler B., 2005, MARKET LEADER, V4, P51##Sage A.

"J","WOS:000355801300007",2015,"Sustainable transport project evaluation and decision support: indicators and planning criteria for sustainable development","This article will expose the necessity for a sustainable planning and decision support framework for transport infrastructure assessment. This will be operationalized through a set of planning criteria and scenario alternatives, which is assessed in the SUSTAIN decision support system (SUSTAIN-DSS) model. A part of the decision support framework will be tested in a case study in Denmark, concerning the problem of congestion on the current bridge crossing Roskilde Fjord in the city of Frederikssund. This article suggests including in a combination both reference class forecasting and quantitative risk analysis as well as sustainable planning criteria in the assessment of the project uncovering new solutions. Thereof the decision support model reveals large potential for the inclusion of planning criteria if the overall objective of development toward a sustainable transportation system is adopted. The SUSTAIN-DSS model rests upon multi-criteria decision analysis and planning workshops in order to combine the use of qualitative and quantitative assessments. This article stresses the necessity of revising current planning paradigms such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA) but also to make clear definitions of the criteria planned for, in order to achieve a sustainable transport system. This alternative approach proves that with relatively small changes in objectives, sustainable development within transport planning can be reached.","COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; TOOL","transport assessment; decision support system; sustainable development; multiplicative AHP; sustainability planning criteria","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Salling, KB##Pryn, MR","[Salling, Kim Bang; Pryn, Marie Ridley] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Transport, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Banister D, 2008, TRANSPORT POLICY, V15, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.10.005##Barfod MB, 2015, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V72, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2014.12.001##Barzilai J., 1997, J MULTI CRITERIA DEC, V6, P155##Belton V, 2010, INT SER OPER RES MAN, V142, P209, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-5904-1_8##Beukers E, 2012, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V46, P68, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2011.09.004##Directorate Road, 2010, NEW CONNECTION ROSKI##DMT, 2015, MAN SOC AN GUID REP##EDWARDS W, 1994, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC, V60, P306, DOI 10.1006/obhd.1994.1087##Edwards W, 2007, ADVANCES IN DECISION ANALYSIS: FROM FOUNDATIONS TO APPLICATIONS, P1, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511611308##Flyvbjerg B, 2003, TRANSPORT REV, V23, P71, DOI 10.1080/01441640309904##Gibson Robert B., 2006, Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy and Management, V8, P259, DOI 10.1142/S1464333206002517##Joubert AR, 1997, ECOL ECON, V22, P123, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(97)00573-9##Joumard R, 2010, ECOL INDIC, V10, P136, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.04.002##KAHNEMAN D, 1979, ECONOMETRICA, V47, P263, DOI 10.2307/1914185##Lootsma F.

"J","WOS:000356973900004",2015,"Towards Integration at Last? The Sustainable Development Goals as a Network of Targets","In 2014, United Nations member states proposed a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as reference goals for the international development community for the period 2015-2030. The proposed goals and targets can be seen as a network, in which links among goals exist through targets that refer to multiple goals. Using network analysis techniques, we show that some thematic areas covered by the SDGs are well connected with one another. Other parts of the network have weaker connections with the rest of the system. The SDGs as a whole are a more integrated system than the MDGs were, which may facilitate policy integration across sectors. However, many of the links among goals that have been documented in biophysical, economic and social dimensions are not explicitly reflected in the SDGs. Beyond the added visibility that the SDGs provide to links among thematic areas, attempts at policy integration across various areas will have to be based on studies of the biophysical, social and economic systems at appropriate scales.

Our analyses, performed for all pillars of sustainability: social, economic and environmental-technical, were based on sustainable development indicators (SDIs). The set of 21 sustainable development indicators, based on freely available statistical data, was proposed in this paper. The SDIs for Lublin Voivodeship were compared to values for Poland and the European Union. The special attention was put to assessment of sustainable development diversification between urbanized and rural areas of Poland and Lublin province. Our analyses showed than both, Poland and Lublin Voivodeship, clearly developed during the last decade but their sustainable development is still endangered and slowed down by several causes. Moreover, the value of most tested sustainability indicators was significantly below the European mean.","DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS","sustainable development; sustainable development assessment; sustainable development indicators; regional diversification","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Widomski, MK##Glen, P##Lagod, G##Jaromin-Glen, KM","[Widomski, Marcin K.; Lagod, Grzegorz] Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Environm Engn, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.

Recent studies identify rapid and unplanned urbanisation as a major threat. With Africa expected to become a home to nearly quarter (13 billion) of the world's urban population in 2050, research into the ramifications of urbanisation on the functionality of the region's urban environment is urgent and tenable.

"J","WOS:000359294800005",2015,"GLOBAL PROSPERITY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS","Negotiations around Sustainable Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda should go beyond just re-writing goals and targets that adhere to sustaining' the same old economic and social models. Instead, societies and governments should take this as an opportunity to advance more radical conceptual and practical approaches that challenge this reductive understanding of sustainability'. The paper argues that we should turn our attention to prosperity rather than to development per se, recognising the critical role political and social innovation should have in unleashing individuals' potential to flourishing in a context of finite resources. The interwoven, interdependent and ever-evolving nature of socio-ecological systems, together with the uncertainties and unknowns' that characterise contemporary reality, questions the relevance of one-size-fits-all goals.

A comparative study of Copenhagen and Hangzhou","In this paper I examine the extent to which economic growth and housing stock growth have been decoupled from negative environmental impacts over the latest two decades in the metropolitan areas of Hangzhou (China) and Copenhagen (Denmark). Research results show that housing stock growth and economic growth have been, at best, weakly decoupled from environment impacts, implying that the goal of sustainable housing development has not been fulfilled by the decoupling strategies. On the basis of this, constraints to decoupling strategies for housing sustainable development are discussed, which indicates a long-term incompatibility between housing stock growth and environmental sustainability. Arguably, sustainable housing development should be pursued by nongrowth in the housing stock in affluent countries in order to reduce the environmental impacts from housing consumption to a sustainable level. The visions for a nongrowth housing stock in both city regions are imagined in terms of potential risks and countermeasures.","URBAN; ENERGY","decoupling strategies; sustainable housing development; urban development; nongrowth","ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY","Xue, J","Aalborg Univ, Dept Dev & Planning, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark.","Environmental Studies; Public Administration","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration","ANDERSEN HT, 1995, CITIES, V12, P13, DOI 10.1016/0264-2751(95)91862-A##[Anonymous], 2009, CHINA ENERGY STAT YB##Azar C, 2002, DECOUPLING TRENDS PR##BARRY J, 2003, INT J ENV SUSTAINABL, V2, P237, DOI DOI 10.1504/IJESD.2003.003842##Cai WG, 2009, ENERG POLICY, V37, P2054, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2008.11.037##Dijst M., 2001, J TRANSP GEOGR, V9, P173, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0966-6923(01)00009-6##EEA, 2006, RB SPRAWL EUR##Feng J, 2002, URBAN PLANNING REV, V138, P42##[<U+51AF><U+5065> Feng Jian], 2002, [<U+5730><U+7406><U+5B66><U+4E0E><U+56FD><U+571F><U+7814><U+7A76>, Geography and Territorial Research], V18, P88##Gram-Hanssen K, 2009, ENHR 2009 C PRAG##Green City Index, 2009, GREEN CIT IND##Guan K, 2001, BUILD RES INF, V29, P286, DOI 10.1080/09613210122304##Hansen AL, 2001, EUR PLAN STUD, V9, P851, DOI 10.1080/09654310120079805##Hartoft-Nielsen P, 2002, BYPLAN, V1, P30##Harvey D., 2010, ENIGMA CAPITAL CRISI##Hovedstadens Udviklingsrad, 2005, REG 2005 HOV##IEA, 2007, INT DAT##Jackson T., 2009, PROSPERITY GROWTH EC##Knudstrup MA, 2009, RENEW ENERG, V34, P2007, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2009.02.002##Marsh R, 2010, BUILD RES INF, V38, P92, DOI 10.1080/09613210903226608##Naess P, 2006, URBAN STUD, V43, P627, DOI 10.1080/00420980500534677##Naess P, 2006, RTPI LIB SER, P1##Naess P, 2001, EUR PLAN STUD, V9, P503, DOI 10.1080/713666490##Nass P., 2010, J TRANSP LAND USE, V3, P27, DOI [10.5198/jtlu.v3i3.98, DOI 10.5198/JTLU.V3I3.98]##Newman P., 1999, SUSTAINABILITY CITIE##OECD, 2002, IND MEAS DEC ENV PRE##Owen D, 2012, CONUNDRUM TYPING SAV##Qiu B, 2006, CITY PLANNING REV, V11, P18##Sorrell S, 2009, ENERG POLICY, V37, P1356, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2008.11.026##Spatial Data Library, 2009, CALC GROWTH URB LAND##Stead D., 2001, EUROPEAN J TRANSPORT, V1, P113##Tapio P, 2005, TRANSP POLICY, V12, P137, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2005.01.001##Vestergaard H, 2006, HOUS URBAN POLICY ST, V30, P75##[<U+738B><U+4F1F><U+6B66> WANG Wei-wu], 2009, [<U+5730><U+7406><U+7814><U+7A76>, Geographical Research], V28, P685##Wang Y P, 2003, SOICAL POLICY REFORM, P177##World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##Xue J, 2011, INT J URBAN SUSTAIN, V3, P185, DOI 10.1080/19463138.2011.607166##Zegras C, 2010, URBAN STUD, V47, P1793, DOI 10.1177/0042098009356125##Zhu YX, 2004, ENERG BUILDINGS, V36, P1287, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2003.11.007##2010, SHANGHAI STAT YB",10,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM5","no","SDG.11"

This special volume stream is comprised of 33 papers that illustrate some of the efforts being taken by higher education institutions to contribute to sustainability. The majority of the papers were presented at the European Roundtable on Sustainable Consumption and Production - Environmental Management for Sustainable Universities conference in Istanbul, Turkey in 2013. The papers address topics such as implementation of sustainable development, stakeholder engagement and participation, campus operations, sustainability reporting and assessment, organisational change management, and curriculum development the papers in this special volume stream provide significant steps for the higher education for sustainable development discipline by exploring new and rethink theories, approaches, concepts, methods, and frameworks, as well as providing case studies and guidelines for practitioners. As the collection of papers shows, there have been many efforts in the implementation of sustainable development in higher education institutions; however, there are still many challenges to integrate sustainable development into their systems, and many opportunities for research in the topic.

Thus, this study aims to identify the product, process and management innovations implemented by a dairy cooperative, and its impact on economic, social and environmental dimensions. This study is characterized as descriptive and qualitative approach. Therefore, there was a semi-structured interview, adapted from Delgado (2007), with the administrative and financial manager of an organization of the dairy sector, located inside the Rio Grande do Sul State. Initially we attempted to map the innovations product, process and management implemented in the organization in the years 2011 to 2013. Later, we sought, based on the respondent perceptions, what were the impacts of each of the innovations mapped in economic spheres, environmental and social sustainable development. The main findings of the study show that the innovations implemented by the organization are directed to the acquisition of new machinery and upgrading of infrastructure. Mapped innovations generated impacts mainly for the social and economic spheres of sustainable development.",NA,"Sustainable Development; Innovation; Cooperative","REVISTA ELETRONICA EM GESTAO EDUCACAO E TECNOLOGIA AMBIENTAL","Tomazzoni, GC##dos Santos, RDT##dos Santos, AS##Costa, VMF","[Tomazzoni, Gean Carlos; Trindade dos Santos, Rita de Cassia; dos Santos, Andressa Schaurich; Flores Costa, Vania Medianeira] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ASHLEY P.

According to the data obtained from the scales, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed in the process of testing the construct validity of the scale. As the result of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, it was found that the model consisting of 30 items and single factor was theoretically and statistically appropriate. And when the results obtained regarding reliability are considered, it can be said that the scale has reliability at sufficient level.

A discussion about perception of energy security, future trends of energy consumption, economic growth and mode of impact of energetically secure economic growth on environment and level of international competitiveness is elaborated on. The authors suggest conceptual approaches towards formulating measurable aims for sustainable and internationally competitive economic developments, which would allow us to achieve comparative compatibility of unrestricted energy availability and development of industrial constitute of countries economies, which would not lead to gradual degradation of environment and decline of international competitiveness in the long run.","ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS-CURVE; GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSIONS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; LITHUANIA; GROWTH; PECULIARITIES; PRECONDITION; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT","energy security; sustainable development; industry development; international long-term competitiveness","ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA","Tvaronaviciene, M##Maciulis, A##Lankauskiene, T##Raudeliuniene, J##Dzemyda, I","[Tvaronaviciene, Manuela; Lankauskiene, Toma; Raudeliuniene, Jurgita; Dzemyda, Ignas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Business Management Fac, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.

"J","WOS:000363039300002",2015,"Sustainable Development and Its Discontents","Sustainable development (or sustainability) is a decision-making framework for maintaining and achieving human well-being, both in the present and into the future. The framework requires both consideration and the achievement of environmental protection, social justice and economic development. In that framework, environmental protection must be integrated into decisions about social and economic development, and social justice and economic viability must be integrated into decisions about environmental quality. As sustainable development has grown in prominence, its critics have become more numerous and more vocal. Three major lines of criticism are that the term is 'too boring' to command public attention, 'too vague' to provide guidance, and 'too late' to address the world's problems. Critics suggest goals such as abundance, environmental integrity, and resilience. Beginning with the international agreements that have shaped the concept of sustainable development, this article provides a functional and historical analysis of the meaning of sustainable development. It then analyzes and responds to each of the above criticisms. It argues that the critics, understood constructively, suggest ways of strengthening this framework, but do not provide a compelling alternative. The challenge for lawyers, lawmakers, and others is to use and improve the sustainability framework to make better decisions.",NA,"Sustainable development; Sustainability; Integrated decision making; Rio Declaration; Resilience","TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW","Dernbach, JC##Cheever, F","[Dernbach, John C.] Widener Univ, Commonwealth Law Sch, Harrisburg, PA USA.

AN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH AMONG MASTER STUDENTS","Sustainable development is a key concept and also a real alternative to traditional, unfortunately not sustainable, development models. The effective challenge of implementing a sustainable development model is to promote as its main driver sustainability-oriented ventures, i.e. firms meeting both profitability, environmental and social requirements. Nevertheless, as the entrepreneurs of the future are today young people, and given that present entrepreneurial intentions are the best predictor of future entrepreneurial behaviour, we focus in this article on investigating students attitude towards involving in sustainability-related businesses. Therefore, we have developed a survey-based research among master students in Business Administration and Managerial Engineering from a Romanian public university as to reveal their availability for sustainability-related entrepreneurial career, their understanding on what sustainability really means and which specific actions are they expecting to undertake in this direction. Furthermore, we found out that students expect from universities (including academic curricula, specific academic programs, specific lectures, etc.) to be the most important 'provider' of adequate entrepreneurial, sustainability-related skills and abilities. Consequently, universities should seriously take into consideration adjustments in their strategic actions in the direction of a closer link with the business environment and a more effective involvement in promoting sustainable economic development.","ENGINEERING STUDENTS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; EDUCATION","sustainable development; businesses; master students","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY","Badulescu, D##Bungau, C##Badulescu, A","[Badulescu, D.; Bungau, C.; Badulescu, A.] Univ Oradea, Oradea 410087, Romania.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Anderson T.

"J","WOS:000363406100004",2015,"Green Marketing for Sustainable Development: an Industry Perspective","This paper investigates and compares acceptability, perceptions, initiatives and obstacles perceived by public and private manufacturing concerns in India in respect of green marketing. The sample of companies was selected from Delhi and north-western region of India. The study reveals that both public-sector and private-sector companies are concerned for environment and believe that green marketing is relevant for sustainable development. It is also perceived as a promotional tool to build customer trust. Obstacles concerning adoption of green marketing by Indian industry are highlighted. The study calls for business firms to adopt environmentalism as a market opportunity rather than merely as compliance to increasing environmental pressures and legislations. Green marketing should become a norm in a developing country like India rather than an exception as it has the potential to contribute substantially in saving the world from environmental pollution and contribute to sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000363553100003",2015,"Rethinking sustainable development within the framework of poverty and urbanisation in developing countries","Since its emergence in the 1980s, the ideology underpinning sustainable development has become a metaphor for describing human welfare and environmental management. However, previous studies have overly focused on environmental aspects with little known about poverty urbanisation implications on sustainable development. Given the magnitude of urbanisation and the pervasiveness of poverty in developing countries, this paper advocates for a poverty -urbanisation analytical approach to sustainable development in developing countries. First, the article provides an overview of sustainable development discourse. Second, the paper looks at the concepts of poverty and urbanisation and their ramifications on sustainable development. Third, examples of sustainable development policy initiatives and their associated poverty urbanisation threats are presented. Fourth, the paper discusses the policy implications of these two phenomena on sustainable development. The paper concludes with some key issues necessary to make sustainable development a reality in developing countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000367407000058",2016,"Sustainable Development Goals: A need for relevant indicators","At the UN in New York the Open Working Group created by the UN General Assembly proposed a set of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which comprises 17 goals and 169 targets. Further to that, a preliminary set of 330 indicators was introduced in March 2015. Some SDGs build on preceding Millennium Development Goals while others incorporate new ideas. A critical review has revealed that indicators of varied quality (in terms of the fulfilment certain criteria) have been proposed to assess sustainable development. Despite the fact that there is plenty of theoretical work on quality standards for indicators, in practice users cannot often be sure how adequately the indicators measure the monitored phenomena. Therefore we stress the need to operationalise the Sustainable Development Goals' targets and evaluate the indicators' relevance, the characteristic of utmost importance among the indicators' quality traits. The current format of the proposed SDGs and their targets has laid a policy framework; however, without thorough expert and scientific follow up on their operationalisation the indicators may be ambiguous. Therefore we argue for the foundation of a conceptual framework for selecting appropriate indicators for targets from existing sets or formulating new ones. Experts should focus on the ""indicator-indicated fact"" relation to ensure the indicators' relevance in order for clear, unambiguous messages to be conveyed to users (decision- and policy-makers and also the lay public). Finally we offer some recommendations for indicators providers in order to contribute to the tremendous amount of conceptual work needed to lay a strong foundation for the development of the final indicators framework.

"J","WOS:000367758100089",2016,"Energy structure of Turkey for sustainable development","Total energy consumption per capita of any country is a critical input for the economic and social development. But nowadays, the current energy production systems are not sustainable and they are not environment friendly. Increased fossil energy consumptions in manufacturing, transportation and standard of living in the growing population have the highest impact on the environment in terms of global warming potential and air pollution. Also fossil fuel prices are increasing because of shortening of fossil fuel sources. Sustainable development improves standard of life economically and environmentally over the long term in a way that must be supported by the industrial structure of the country. In order to sustain energy availability and keep environment livable for future generations, finding new alternatives is necessary. Increased awareness of society about environmental issues and fossil energy sources depletion support new clean alternatives. These alternatives are one of the important and determinant policy areas for the countries, and should include both short and long term energy policies. This paper discusses the environmental pollution caused by energy consumption, and the role of conventional and renewable energy technologies as one component of the effective sustainable development and solution. Also, renewable energy potential of Turkey for assessment of the green energy systems is investigated in terms of sustainable development, environmental impact and prices. All the given results in this paper will be useful to researchers, engineers, decision and policy makers in industry and government. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000367762500082",2015,"Integration of sustainable development in higher education - a regional initiative in Quebec (Canada)","Integration of sustainable development in education is now being addressed in numerous educational institutions across the globe. Based on different integration approaches, various teaching methods are being developed, applied and evaluated. Efforts are also being made in the direction of strengthening pedagogical approaches as well as educator training to address issues such as, lack of awareness and resources required for a better transfer of sustainable development knowledge from educator to students. There is a strong need for these two approaches (integration & pedagogical) to work in close association for an improved level of integration. Regional collaborations are an effective way to address such issues. They can play a key role in achieving sustainability regionally while being influenced by, and influencing, both local and global communities, and that is the main hypothesis of this paper. The goal of this paper is to present a regionalized educational initiative for integration of sustainable development in higher education made by two universities and five colleges in Quebec (Canada). This project is not only dedicated to teaching or application of approaches but is also expanded to: 1) professors' support using various activities (conferences, workshops and short lectures); 2) program integrations; 3) integration at institutional level (as some institutions have adopted various policies and actions regarding their overall missions of research, community outreach and operations); and, 4) regional collaboration between the seven academic partners, which is a unique characteristic of this project. As a result, this regional collaborative approach helped in building a critical mass of practitioners in the field and launched a community of practice and integrated sustainable development in the member institutions at different levels, strengthening the educator's knowledge on sustainable development pedagogy. Based on the preliminary analysis of surveys taken by students, this integration has helped in developing the understanding of sustainable development by students and has also resulted in a positive attitude towards sustainable development. In addition, the integrations as a result of the collaboration show that integration of sustainable development in higher education is accomplished not only through pedagogical and extracurricular activities but is also embodied in the overall student experience on campus.

"J","WOS:000368842100002",2015,"The global partnership for sustainable development","This paper examines whether foreign aid, together with other economic, social and environmental factors, contributes to sustainable development. It starts with an illustrative theoretical growth model where foreign aid promotes sustainable development by protecting the environment. Using factor analysis and newly developed estimation methods for a dynamic panel data model with endogenous regressors, the empirical section of the paper finds evidence that foreign aid has had a significantly positive influence on sustainable development in aid recipient countries. This effect is very likely to go through channels related to growth and resources as well as a technology channel with respect to energy intensity. This research has important implications for a post-2015 development framework on international collective action with regard to a sustainable future.","PANEL-DATA; GROWTH; AID; NUMBER","Sustainable development; aid effectiveness; post-2015 development agenda; economic growth; natural resource exploitations; energy intensity; factor-IV; factor-GMM","NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM","Huang, YF##Quibria, MG","[Huang, Yongfu] China Ctr Int Econ Exchanges, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000369088600065",2015,"The Effectiveness of Education for Sustainable Development","Perhaps the most important issue in our time is how to sustain our planet's resources, while developing wealth and well-being for a growing population. This monumental task has been defined in the concept of sustainable development (SD). During the last few decades the world communities have agreed upon addressing SD through international treaties. As a response Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) has been launched as an answer to cope with sustainability. However, empirical studies are a missing link in the discourse around ESD, where decisions and implementation strategies are heavily based on policy recommendations and gut feelings by practitioners. We used data from 2413 students in grades 6, 9, and 12 from 51 schools across Sweden to study the effectiveness of ESD. In line with the current debate on the definition of ESD, we quantified the extent to which teaching can be labeled as holistic and/or pluralistic. Through a series of descriptive analyses and the estimation of structural equation models, our results indicate that ESD can indeed impact on student outcomes in terms of their sustainability consciousness. The results of this study reveal the key role ESD plays in addressing SD, paving the way for a more sustainable future.","ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION; ECO-SCHOOLS; BOUND DIFFERENCES; ACTION COMPETENCE; DEVELOPMENT ESD; EXPERIENCES; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; PROGRAM; VALUES","Education for Sustainable Development; educational effectiveness; holism; pluralism; sustainability consciousness","SUSTAINABILITY","Boeve-de Pauw, J##Gericke, N##Olsson, D##Berglund, T","[Boeve-de Pauw, Jelle; Gericke, Niklas; Olsson, Daniel; Berglund, Teresa] Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.

How well does technology innovation research address the needs of sustainable development and in what directions does this research need to move to usher in sustainable development? We use co-word analysis in existing research publications to map the intellectual structure of the field of 'strategic technological innovation for sustainable development' during the period 1989-2009. The results suggest a list of 26 different research themes. Certain research themes are considered to be central and represent coherent and well-developed concepts. Other themes have arisen, matured, and then faded as major research concepts. Some other themes seem to be emerging or immature, but they signal the appearance of new research areas that are becoming central. Finally, there are some areas that are peripheral and others that need further development.

Our contemporary critical analysis of Stefan Bengtsson's research about policy making leads us to different interpretations of some key observations and assertions about sustainable development (SD) and education for sustainable development (ESD). To counter the persistent weight of the underpinning resourcist and economic view of the relationship between people and the environment, we examine other perspectives about economy, about people and society, and about the environment. These divergences insist upon diversity in education and in environmental education.","VALUES","national and international policy; educational and social paradigms; environmental education; sustainable development","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION","Berryman, T##Sauve, L","[Berryman, Tom; Sauve, Lucie] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.","Education & Educational Research; Environmental Studies","Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Agha Khan S, 2005, MANIERE VOIRLE MONDE, V81, P68##[Anonymous], 2015, LAUDATO SI##Asamblea legislativa plurinacionalBolivia, 2012, MARC MADR TIERR DES##Auzou E., 2013, ECOALIMENTATIN BELLE##Bayon D, 2012, DECROISSANCE DIX QUE##Bengtsson SL, 2016, J ENVIRON EDUC, V47, P77, DOI 10.1080/00958964.2015.1021291##BERR E, 2013, REV FRANCOPHONE DEV, V2, P8##Berryman T., 2011, ED ENV DEV DURABLE V, P45##Berryman T., 2008, POUR, V198, P54##Berryman T., 1999, CANADIAN J ENV ED, V4, P50##Berryman T., 2006, ED RELATIVE ENV REGA, V6, P137##Berryman T, 2013, INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION, P133##Blackmore E., 2013, COMMON CAUSE NATURE##Brenner A., 2010, MANUEL ETHIQUE ENV T##Brunelle R., 2007, CANADIAN J ENV ED, P33##Calvino I., 1985, MR PALOMAR##Childs A., 2007, RES SCI TECHNOLOGICA, V25, P307, DOI [DOI 10.1080/02635140701535067, 10.1080/02635140701535067]##Chilton P., 2012, COMMUNICATING BIGGER##Clement P., 2011, ED DEV DURABLE EDD C##Cling J-P., 2013, REV REGULATION, V13##Crompton T., 2009, M ENV CHALLENGES ROL##D'Alisa G., 2014, DEGROWTH VOCABULARY, pXXIII##Delgado F., 2010, DESARROLLO ENDOGENO##DESCOLA P, 2005, PARDELA NATURE CULTU##DESCOLA Phillipe, 2014, COMPOSITION MONDES##Evernden Neil, 1985, NATURAL ALIEN HUMANK##Fischer-Kowalski M., 2012, SOCIOECOLOGICAL TRAS##Gabriele A, 2006, REV INT POLIT ECON, V13, P258, DOI 10.1080/09692290600625504##Gendron C, 2014, ECOL ECON, V105, P240, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.06.012##Girault Y., 2013, ED RELATIVE ENV REGA, V11, P61##GIRAULT Y., 2008, ASTER, P7##Gonzalez-Gaudiano E., 2015, SUSTAINABILITY FRONT, P43##Gutierrez G.

Current activities in this field endeavour to create comprehensive solutions at all levels, ranging from local to global. Their planning should take into account the coexistence and interaction of the three capitals: economic, social and environmental. This article presents the essence of sustainable development, which seeks to harmonise these capitals. The proposal is to consider them in accordance with the principles of the system approach. It will show that the implementation of this idea requires entrepreneurial activities aimed at rationalising and modernising the economic, social, and ecological subsystems, as well as their integration to achieve synergy.

"J","WOS:000372690100022",2016,"Principles and criteria of sustainable development for the mineral exploration industry","Mineral exploration has experienced significant growth over the past decade. Characterized by the absence of production revenues, mineral exploration companies rely on investors, who are increasingly concerned about environmental compliance and social acceptability. Although several guidelines have been developed (e.g. e3 Plus, ISO 26000, BNQ 21000), none provides for third -party evaluation and issuing of a certificate of compliance with sustainable development principles. Given the specificities of the mineral exploration industry, a sectorial certification standard would be better suited to frame their activities. This study suggests a set of principles and criteria of sustainable development that could be the basis for developing a sectorial standard for the mineral exploration industry. Available sustainable development guidelines were analyzed in order to obtain a preliminary list of principles and criteria. A Delphi survey involving 44 experts then allowed to obtain a final, consensual list of 8 principles (Environmental quality, Quality of life, Work environment, Local investment, Business ethics, Transparency and reporting, Innovation, Economic efficiency) and 27 criteria.

This paper examines the contributions of an employee-owned hotel to sustainable development in North Cyprus. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with employees and managers and by analyzing the relevant documents. The employee ownership system was found to have a positive socio-economic impact on the development of sustainable tourism. The employee ownership system enabled the hotel to establish strong and long-term relations with the local community by generating new and stable local employment, fairly distributing business opportunities in their local community, improving the locals' quality of life and preserving an iconic built resource of the island. The factors that helped the new ownership system at the hotel to be successful in this case are identified as ethical leadership, people-centered human resource practices, autonomy, collaboration with the local community and customers, and political willpower.

"J","WOS:000374748400027",2016,"Crafting usable knowledge for sustainable development","This paper distills core lessons about how researchers (scientists, engineers, planners, etc.) interested in promoting sustainable development can increase the likelihood of producing usable knowledge. We draw the lessons from both practical experience in diverse contexts around the world and from scholarly advances in understanding the relationships between science and society. Many of these lessons will be familiar to those with experience in crafting knowledge to support action for sustainable development. However, few are included in the formal training of researchers. As a result, when scientists and engineers first venture out of the laboratory or library with the goal of linking their knowledge with action, the outcome has often been ineffectiveness and disillusionment. We therefore articulate here a core set of lessons that we believe should become part of the basic training for researchers interested in crafting usable knowledge for sustainable development. These lessons entail at least four things researchers should know, and four things they should do. The knowing lessons involve understanding the coproduction relationships through which knowledge making and decision making shape one another in social-environmental systems. We highlight the lessons that emerge from examining those coproduction relationships through the ICAP lens, viewing them from the perspectives of Innovation systems, Complex systems, Adaptive systems, and Political systems. The doing lessons involve improving the capacity of the research community to put its understanding of coproduction into practice.

The data collected for the present investigation were obtained from sustainability indicators mentioned by the literature and available on the website of the World Bank, for the period between 2006 and 2013. It was observed that, in relation to economic and social development, cooperation between the BRICS' countries is efficient, resulting in improvements in these aspects. In relation to environmental sustainability, it was observed that it is not being properly covered by the plans of cooperation of the BRICS. Thus, it appears that, despite recent, the BRICS have sustainable development opportunities. However, extra care and effort must be employed in promoting sustainable environmental development of these emerging countries, as well as measures to promote the continuity of advances in economic and social development.",NA,"Sustainable Development; BRICS; Contextual Analysis","REUNIR-REVISTA DE ADMINISTRACAO CONTABILIDADE E SUSTENTABILIDADE","Morel, APS##Vaz, JM##Lopes, PF##da Silva, SS","[Sales Morel, Aline Pereira; Vaz, Janderson Martins; Lopes, Patrick Fernandes] Univ Fed Lavras, PPGA, Adm, Rua Joao Bernardino,101,Bairro Vila Rica, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.

"J","WOS:000375809500019",2016,"Assessing sustainable development across Moldova using household and property composition indicators","Societies are committing themselves to sustainable development by attempting to improve environmental quality, social equity, and economic welfare. As such, there continues a plea for holistic development assessment across scales; however there remains no ideal technique for achieving sustainability on neither regional nor local scale. This paper approaches this problem by constructing a multi-metric assessment system for evaluating development patterns across the Republic of Moldova. The objectives of this study were: (1) to produce a local multi-metric index that captures the three major dimensions of sustainable development for Moldova; (2) to quantitatively evaluate the interrelatedness of sub-metrics used for creating the local composite index of sustainable development; and (3) to visualize and interpret spatial patterns of sustainable development across Moldova. A local sustainable development index (LSDI) was produced using household and property composition indicators from a 2005 demographic and health survey for the Republic of Moldova. Total sample size and aggregated spatial reference was 11,066 households and 399 geographic locations, respectively. The LSDI used a 15 sub metric optimum, equal weighting, 1-5 ordinal scale standardization, and additive construction. Spear man's rank correlation coefficient analysis was used to evaluate sub-metric quantitative relationships, and local Moran's I-test to interpret geographic patterns of sustainable development. Results revealed that a wealth sub-index had greatest collinearity with other sub-metrics. Geographically, Moldova's improved sustainability levels were found in large urban areas, suggesting needed prioritization of development resources to the hinterland. For regional sustainable development assessments, this approach provides the transferability to other locally referenced datasets throughout the world. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000376613600007",2016,"Sustainable development goals and inclusive development","Achieving sustainable development has been hampered by trade-offs in favour of economic growth over social well-being and ecological viability, which may also affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by the member states of the United Nations. In contrast, the concept of inclusive development emphasizes the social, ecological and political dimensions of development. In this context, this paper addresses the question: What does inclusive development mean and to what extent is it taken into account in the framing of the SDGs? It presents inclusive development as having three key dimensions (social, ecological, and relational inclusiveness) with five principles each. This is applied to the 17 SDGs and their targets. The paper concludes that while the text on the SDGs fares quite well on social inclusiveness, it fares less well in respect to ecological and relational inclusiveness. This implies that there is a risk that implementation processes also focus more on social inclusiveness rather than on ecological and relational inclusiveness.

Like all concepts, we understand the meaning and act according to the conceptual metaphors that illuminate and articulate the term SD. The attention given to the technical aspects of SD far outweighs the attention given to the way the concept has been constructed and organized as theory and practice are built. In this article, we examine the conceptual metaphors that form the foundation for SD theory and practice. We suggest that these conceptual metaphors reveal problematic understandings and assumptions. Through a conceptualization of paradigm, we describe the constituent elements as frame, worldview, and posture.

Worldwide social inequalities are widening because of the increasing environmental pressure put on the fragile ecological equilibrium of our planet. The fact that the planetary boundaries have to be respected is now known as well as the necessity to fully endorse the concept of sustainable development. Sustainability is key to overcome the challenges of our time, but can only be achieved with the involvement of the whole society. In that regard, giving citizens the right tools to this achievement is crucial and delivering environmental justice is essential. Environmental access rights represent these tools and have the potential to place the global agenda on a sustainable trajectory, as demonstrated by various examples around the world. Access to information, public participation and access to justice have, therefore, the potential to make sustainable development a reality. Notwithstanding, if environmental democracy for all is to be achieved, then sustainable development still needs to be universally achieved.",NA,"Environmental access rights; access to information; public participation; access to justice; sustainable development; environmental justice; environmental democracy","ASIAN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW","Mrema, EM##Hantschel, M","[Mrema, Elizabeth Maruma] UNEP Div Environm Law & Convent, Nairobi, Kenya.

To identify reported interventions that facilitate sustainable development and have had a positive impact on health in four areas: sustainable food production; sustainable energy use; sustainable jobs (""decent work""); and prevention of toxic exposure to chemicals. Methods. Systematic review methods were used to synthesize evidence from multiple systematic reviews and economic evaluations. A comprehensive search was conducted of at least 14 databases and 8 websites for each of the four overviews, using pre-defined protocols, including clear inclusion criteria. To qualify as ""sustainable,"" interventions needed to aim (explicitly or implicitly) to positively impact at least two dimensions of the integrated framework for sustainable development and had to include measures of health impact. Results. In total, 47 systematic reviews and 10 economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. The most promising interventions, such as agricultural policies, were identified for each of the four topics. While the evidence for the interventions is not strong because of the limited number of studies, there is no evidence of a definite negative impact on health. The only possible exception is that of taxes and subsidies-though this intervention also has the potential to be pro-equity with higher relative impacts for lower income groups. Conclusions. The evidence found for effective interventions is useful for guiding countries toward the best options for non-health sector interventions that can positively impact health. This overviews shows that intersectoral work benefits every sector involved.","WORKPLACE REORGANIZATION; OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ORGANIC FOODS; STRATEGIES; BENEFITS; OBESITY; CONSUMPTION; EMPLOYMENT","Sustainable development; sustainable development goals; review; systematic; sustainable agriculture; environment and public health; equity in health; employment; United Nations","REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH","Galvao, LAC##Haby, MM##Chapman, E##Clark, R##Camara, VM##Luiz, RR##Becerra-Posada, F","[Galvao, Luiz A.

From the notion of complexity, which perceives the human being as a member of the environmental, the article proposes a social awareness for the establishment of public actions to enable the solution for the problem concerning the environment sustainability, with the reduction of environmental risks. We aim a scientific analysis of sustainable development and sustainability of natural resources, especially water. From the deductive method, it discusses as sustainable development can resolve the risks of the advances of the agricultural frontier, using, consciously, natural resources, especially water, in compliance with the legislation devices. Therefore, the article will discuss ways of planning and management that enable the conservation of water resources and sustainable development.",NA,"Sustainable Development; Challenges; Risks; Water Resourses","REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE DIREITO","Hamel, EH##Grubba, LS","[Grubba, Leilane Serratine] Fac Merid, Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.

Herein, we conduct a systematic statistical analysis of the contribution of Chinese geographers to sustainable development research using bibliometric methods. Based on the review of a vast amount of literature, we identify the main research teams, research funding sources, journals, and key research fields. The findings are as follows: (1) the resources and environmental institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have a significant influence on sustainable development research; (2) China's central government foundations (the National Natural Science Foundation of China and National Social Sciences Fund) are the main research funding sources; (3) most of the highly cited articles are published in journals sponsored by the Geographical Society of China; and (4) sustainable development theory and its research areas are being constantly enriched and perfected.

"J","WOS:000380808800006",2015,"SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES","Discussions on economic development, environmental theoretical currents and the United Nations (UN) international conferences have deepened the concept of sustainable development. Based on these elements, sustainable development is multidimensional as it incorporates several sustainabilities, such as economic, social, environmental and political-institutional. In addition, it is noteworthy that, with the advent of Agenda 21, the discussions on sustainable development also revealed the need to produce information concerning the state of development. Therefore, this study sought to prove, by way of exploratory research, the importance of measuring the sustainable development by presenting the main techniques used. Among them, there are indicators' landmarks organisers and methodologies for building of indexes. As a corollary, it was observed that, apart from differences related to the distinct characteristics of each method, all are relevant in decision making, and this is essential to carry out actions, both by private and public institutions, in order to boost sustainability.",NA,"Sustainable development; Indicators; Indexes","REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS","Rodrigues, KF##Rippel, R","[Rodrigues, Katia Fabiane; Rippel, Ricardo] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana UNIOESTE, Cascavel, PR, Brazil.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Agarwala A.

Design/methodology/approach - This study integrates the mainstream and Islamic positions on the subject of the environment and sustainable development based on published literature and argues that whichever definition of environmental development one might subscribe to eventually each arrives at an environmental concern. It takes inspiration from the verses of the Holy Quran and ethics of the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in respect of environment and business that indicate a way out of this impasse. Findings - This study shows that the Islamic approach is more agreeable to environmental protection, and the issues associated with environmental and sustainable development have moral, ethical and social responsibilities, and the businesses should have on intense commitment to Islamic ethics in justice and welfare of human beings. Because of environmental ethics in Islam, and the value chain of suppliers through customers, businesses should be aware of the environmental aspects and impacts of their companies. Originality/value - This paper enhances the understanding of Islamic ethical responsibilities in business, environmental and sustainable development and attempts to show attributes of the various levels of behaviour of an organisation.",NA,"Ethics; Sustainable development; Islamic business ethics","HUMANOMICS","Hassan, A","[Hassan, Abul] King Fahad Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Finance & Econ, Ctr Res Excellent Islamic Banking & Finance, Islamic Finance, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.","Economics","Business & Economics","Ahmad K., 1980, STUDIES ISLAMIC EC##Alam Choudhury Masudul, 2010, J ISLAMIC EC BANKING, V6, P37##Ansari M., 1994, AM J ISLAMIC SOCIAL, P394##Asad M., 1987, THIS LAW OF OURS##Baker I., 1998, ISLAM ENV##Beekun R., 1997, ISLAMIC BUSINESS ETH##Chapra M.

This article focuses on the challenges that affluent countries face today in shifting to a sustainable development path. These challenges include improving the quality of life, achieving environmental sustainability, and addressing inequality. In the United States in particular, these challenges have increased in recent decades, despite significant economic growth. The neoclassical development model assumes that growth makes it easier to achieve sustainable development and that wellbeing rises with per capita income. We question these assumptions, and find a theory of economic development in institutional economics that better explains and accommodates sustainability. We draw on the work of many original institutionalist economists (OIE), and others working in this tradition, to analyze the challenges of sustainable development in affluent countries, especially in the United States.","ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH","abundance; economic development; growth; institutionalism; neoinstitutionalist; provisioning; sustainable development; sustainability","JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES","Greenwood, DT##Holt, RPF","[Greenwood, Daphne T.] Univ Colorado Colorado Springs, Econ, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA.

"J","WOS:000382797300003",2016,"Skills for sustainable development: Transforming vocational education and training beyond 2015","There have been recent calls to transform VET and to transform development. This double call leads us to ask how can skills development best support development that is sustainable for individuals, communities and the planet, and which promotes social justice and poverty reduction. In considering this question, we critique the idea of green skills for the green economy as being inadequate for achieving a transformed and transformative VET that shifts the target from economic growth to the wellbeing of individuals and that enables vocational education to play a role in challenging and transforming society and work. Rather, we argue that we must see human development and sustainable development as inseparable, and plan and evaluate VET for its contribution to these. Such an approach must be grounded in a view of work, and hence skills for work, that is decent, life-enhancing, solidaristic, environmentally sensitive and intergenerationally-aware. It must confront the reality that much current VET is complicit in preparing people for work that lacks some or all of these characteristics. It must be concerned with poverty, inequality and injustice and contribute to their eradication. It must be supportive of individuals' agency, whilst also reflecting a careful reading of the structures that too often constrain them. In doing all this it must minimise the costs and risks of any transformation for the poor and seek to lock them into better individual and communal lives, not out of them. Finally, it must transform skills, work and the world in ways that are truly sustainable of the people of today but also of those who are to inhabit the earth tomorrow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000382983000001",2016,"Religion, Sustainable Development and Policy: Principles to Practice","The nexus between religion and development is now well recognized in scholarship but the implications for development policies are relatively unexplored. The challenge with analysing religion as a policy construct is to ensure that its rich anthropological dimensions are not lost, but rather that these inform the conception and implementation of development planning, especially in diverse, multireligious societies. The aim of this special issue is to unpack the complex anthropological, sociological and even theological dimensions of religion that can enable development policymakers to identify the ways in which religion shapes the society, the environment and the economy. Therein also lie the opportunities to articulate policies that are truly responsive to serious structural issues of inequalities and oppressions. The authors address five foci that are central to sustainable development policymaking - urbanization and spatial equality; gender justice; environment and human/animal tensions; economic growth; and postsecularity and governance.

Taken together, the reports identify links between education and all the SDGs, with the notable exception of SDG 14 on oceans. However, some goal areas have received much more attention than others. While some causal links are identified and highlighted as important, relevant constraints are sometimes not extensively discussed, and few concrete policy options to act on these links are provided. Going forward, it would be important to assess whether the messages contained in UN flagship reports adequately reflect the state of scientific knowledge and the lessons learnt from development programs that focus on education in relation to specific SDGs. The systematic analysis provided here can offer a basis for an integrated analysis of policy priorities for education as a whole.

"J","WOS:000383090700031",2016,"Making technological innovation work for sustainable development","This paper presents insights and action proposals to better harness technological innovation for sustainable development. We begin with three key insights from scholarship and practice. First, technological innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions operating simultaneously from local to global scales. Barriers arise at all stages of innovation, from the invention of a technology through its selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Second, learning from past efforts to mobilize innovation for sustainable development can be greatly improved through structured cross-sectoral comparisons that recognize the socio-technical nature of innovation systems. Third, current institutions (rules, norms, and incentives) shaping technological innovation are often not aligned toward the goals of sustainable development because impoverished, marginalized, and unborn populations too often lack the economic and political power to shape innovation systems to meet their needs. However, these institutions can be reformed, and many actors have the power to do so through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and financing. We conclude with three practiceoriented recommendations to further realize the potential of innovation for sustainable development: (i) channels for regularized learning across domains of practice should be established; (ii) measures that systematically take into account the interests of underserved populations throughout the innovation process should be developed; and (iii) institutions should be reformed to reorient innovation systems toward sustainable development and ensure that all innovation stages and scales are considered at the outset.","RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; SECTORAL SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; RECONFIGURATION; IRRIGATION; STRATEGIES; RESISTANCE","sustainable development; innovation systems; technology; knowledge systems; complex adaptive systems","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","Anadona, LD##Chan, G##Harley, AG##Matus, K##Moon, S##Murthy, SL##Clark, WC","[Anadona, Laura Diaz; Harley, Alicia G.; Moon, Suerie; Clark, William C.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

On the basis of available statistical data it is possible not only to measure the progress and evaluate the effectiveness of policies and programs of the European Union, but also to support decision making at the political level in terms of economic, social and environmental developments.","INDICATORS","sustainable development; sustainable development strategy; indicator; measuring; progress monitoring","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Urbaniec, M","[Urbaniec, Maria] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","[Anonymous], OFFICIAL J EUROPEA L, P39##Borys T., 2014, OPTIMUM STUDIA EKONO, V3, P3, DOI DOI 10.15290/OSE.2014.03.69.01##Borys T, 2011, PROBL EKOROZW, V6, P75##BRUNDTLAND HG, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##Bujanowicz-Haras B, 2015, PROBL EKOROZW, V10, P71##Commission of the European Communities, 2001, SUST EUR BETT WORLD SUST EUR BETT WORLD##Council of the European Union, 2006, REV EU SUST DEV STRA##Czaja S., 2009, INFORM JAKO PODSTAWA, P190##European Commission (COM), 2010, COM20102020, P2020##European Union, 2009, SUST DEV EUR UN 2009##European Union, 2015, SUST DEV EUR UN 2015##European Union, 2013, SUST DEV EUR UN 2013##Famielec J., 2009, WPLYW IDEI ZROWNOWAZ, VI, P36##Gutowska J, 2012, PROBL EKOROZW, V7, P77##Janikowski R., 2014, HUMANITIES SOCIAL SC, VXIX, P71##Preisner L., 1999, PROBL EKOROZW, V3, P9##Rametsteiner E, 2011, ECOL INDIC, V11, P61, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.06.009##Redclift M, 2005, SUSTAIN DEV, V13, P212, DOI 10.1002/sd.281##Spangenberg JH, 2002, SUSTAIN DEV, V10, P103, DOI 10.1002/sd.184##UNCED United Nations Convention on Environment and Development, 1992, AG 21##United Nations, 2008, MEAS SUST DEV##Urbaniec M., 2003, INT J ENV SUSTAINABL, V2, P100##Urbaniec M., 2011, NADZBALTIGE ENTWICKL, P291##Urbaniec M, 2015, ENTREPR BUS ECON REV, V3, P119, DOI 10.15678/EBER.2015.030109##Ziolkowska J., 2010, ANN U PETROSANI EC, V10, P373",4,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM3","no","SDG.12#SDG.17"

Twenty-five years later, as income inequalities grow larger in every part of the world, human development is more relevant than ever. Civil participation in particular has become a central element of sustainable development policies such as the Sustainable Development Goals. Since the beginning of the new millennium, beneficiaries have been involved in an increasing number of development projects. Civil participation is being recognized as an asset to sustainable development for several reasons including improved efficiency, fairness and resilience. A review of reports from development practitioners and best practices in the field of civil participation towards sustainable development highlighted the importance of engaging individuals and communities to secure lasting and equitable progress. Yet, in a number of cases, results are not up to expectations and obstacles are hindering the potential of such initiatives. With the aim of reaching the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, development practitioners can learn from these experiences and integrate civil participation into their programmes more efficiently.",NA,"Civil society; civil participation; human development; development policies; Sustainable Development Goals","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Cazabat, C","[Cazabat, Christelle] UNDP, Human Dev Report Off, New York, NY 10017 USA.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Dreze Jean, 2002, INDIA DEV PARTICIPAT##ECOSOC, 2014, LIST NONG ORG CONS S##International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2015, STAT BROADB 2015 BRO##IRAM, 2012, EV FONDS SOC DEV##Mascherini M, 2011, EUR SOCIOL REV, V27, P790, DOI 10.1093/esr/jcq041##Maupin JN, 2009, SOC SCI MED, V68, P1456, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.01.045##Nussbaum M., 2009, EMPLOYABILITY CAPABI, P15##OECD, 2011, BUS PARTN EFF DEV CO##OECD, 2005, PAR DECL AID EFF, DOI 10.1787/9789264098084-en##OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), 2008, ACCR AG ACT##Perez-Batres LA, 2011, J CLEAN PROD, V19, P843, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.06.003##UN, 2015, TRANSFORMING OUR WOR##*UNCED, 1992, UN C ENV DEV RIO DEC##UNCSD, 2012, FUT WE WANT OUTC DOC##UNDESA, 2014, UN E GOV SURV 2014 E##*UNDP, 2000, HUM DEV REP 2000 HUM##UNDP, 2005, HUM DEV REP 2005 INT##UNICEF, 2016, CHECK OUT CHILDR STA##United Nations, 2015, MILL DEV GOALS REP 2##United Nations Development Programme, 2013, HUMAN DEV REPORT 201##UNV, 2014, STAT FIN INF 2014##World Bank, 2005, CIV SOC ENG REV FISC##World Bank, 2016, WORLD DEV REP 2016 D",1,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM11","no","SDG.12#SDG.10#SDG.3"

Evidence indicates that the spatial dynamics in many Indonesian metropolitan regions are not in accordance with sustainability. This research is thus aimed at empirically examining sustainable metropolitan development of Semarang City, based on a model proposed by Sugiri, Buchori, and Soetomo [2011. Sustainable Metropolitan Development: Towards an Operational Model for Semarang Metropolitan Region. The International Journal of Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability 7 (5): 301-324]. The methods mainly involve spatial analysis using GIS and comparison of statistical data, supported by complementary qualitative information. The results show that the spatial development of Semarang City tends to be unsustainable, based on important indicators. However, the availability of such local initiatives as spatial plans and environmental impact studies should be considered essential in ensuring sustainable development. In addition, the growth of small-scale industries is prospective to increase public involvement in productive activities.","JAKARTA; REGION","Sustainable development; metropolitan; empirical examination","AUSTRALIAN PLANNER","Buchori, I##Sugiri, A","[Buchori, Imam; Sugiri, Agung] Diponegoro Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Fac Engn, Semarang, Indonesia.","Regional & Urban Planning","Public Administration","BECKERMAN W, 1994, ENVIRON VALUE, V3, P191, DOI 10.3197/096327194776679700##Cornier T, 2012, INT J ENVIRON SUSTAI, V11, P64, DOI 10.1504/IJESD.2012.049143##Domfeh KA, 2012, INT J ENVIRON SUSTAI, V11, P304, DOI 10.1504/IJESD.2012.050458##Firman T, 2004, HABITAT INT, V28, P349, DOI 10.1016/S0197-3975(03)00037-7##Firman T, 1994, HABITAT INT, V18, P79, DOI DOI 10.1016/0197-3975(94)90006-X##Firman T, 2009, HABITAT INT, V33, P327, DOI 10.1016/j.habitatint.2008.08.005##Fowke R., 1996, AUSTR PLANNER, V33, P61, DOI DOI 10.1080/07293682.1996.9657714##Gollner A., 1996, AUSTR PLANNER, V33, P136, DOI DOI 10.1080/07293682.1996.9658098##HANLEY N, 1997, ENV EC THEORY PRACTI##Hudalah D, 2013, URBAN GEOGR, V34, P950, DOI 10.1080/02723638.2013.783281##Hudalah D, 2012, CITIES, V29, P40, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2011.07.003##Irawan B, 2005, FORUM PENELIT AGROEK, V23, P1##Kantor Statistik (Statistics Office), 2010, SEM DAL ANGK##Kantor Statistik (Statistics Office), 2000, SEM DAL ANGK##Khadiyanto P, 2005, TATA RUANG BERBASIS##Kozlowski J., 1993, PLANNING SUSTAINABLE, P16##McMahon E.

The paper demonstrates how the impact of corruption on economic development might vary substantially from sustainable development (SD). Design/methodology/approach - A combination of literature-based analysis was employed by considering concepts from corruption and development. A synthesis of these two concepts leads to the development of the conceptual framework. Findings - The findings shows that corruption originates from three main sources, and that the effect of corruption on development might differ depending on how it is conceptualized, but the spate of corruption is contingent on institutional quality and gains in previous development trajectory. Originality/value - Relating the concept of corruption and SD and linking it to theories of development brings a sense of novelty. This paper has in its essence contributed to the conceptualization of the relationship between corruption and development which will help deepen understanding on this contentious subject. The framework will help to improve theory, research and practice in development studies and allied fields.","GROWTH; QUALITY; AID; INSTITUTIONS; GOVERNMENT; WELFARE; ISEW","Governance; Management; Economic development (ED); Sustainable development (SD)","WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Forson, JA","[Forson, Joseph Ato] Natl Inst Dev Adm, Grad Sch Publ Adm, Bangkok, Thailand.","Management","Business & Economics","Acemoglu D, 2000, AM ECON REV, V90, P194, DOI 10.1257/aer.90.1.194##Aghion P, 1997, ENDOGENOUS GROWTH TH##Aghion P, 2016, EUR ECON REV, V86, P24, DOI 10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.01.012##Aidt TS., 2010, 1061 CWPE##Alesina A, 2000, J ECON GROWTH, V5, P33, DOI 10.1023/A:1009874203400##Amundsen I., 2000, POLITICAL CORRUPTION##Anielski M., 2012, GENUINE WEALTH BUILD##Arrow K, 2004, J ECON PERSPECT, V18, P147, DOI 10.1257/0895330042162377##Arrow KJ, 2003, ECON THEOR, V21, P217, DOI 10.1007/s00199-002-0335-2##Asongu S, 2015, ECON BULL, V35, P2288##Atkinson G.D., 1993, ECOL ECON, V8, P103, DOI [DOI 10.1016/0921-8009(93)90039-9, 10.1016/0921-8009(93)90039-9]##Azariadis C., 2012, 2 SECTOR MODEL ENDOG##Bamidele O., 2013, AFRICAN S AFRICAN S, V13, P42##Bardhan P, 1997, J ECON LIT, V35, P1320##Brundtland Commission (World Commission on Environment and Development), 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##Camaj L, 2013, INT J PRESS/POLIT, V18, P21, DOI 10.1177/1940161212462741##Chaufen A.A., 1999, 2000 INDEX EC FREEDO##Chinn P., 1999, THEORY NURSING INTEG##Claros A.L., 2013, REMOVING IMPEDIMENTS##Cobb JB., 1989, COMMON GOOD REDIRECT##COSTANZA R, 1992, ENVIRON MANAGE, V16, P121, DOI 10.1007/BF02393914##Costanza R, 2009, GDP NEED NEW MEASURE##Costanza R, 2007, ECOL ECON, V61, P267, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.02.023##Dasgupta P., 2000, ENVIRON DEV ECON, V5, P69, DOI DOI 10.1017/S1355770X00000061##Diener E., 1999, WELL BEING FDN HEDON, P434##Dietz, 2009, PROCESS EC DEV##Dietz S., 2005, SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CR##Dietz S, 2007, ENVIRON DEV ECON, V12, P33, DOI 10.1017/S1355770X06003378##Dimant E., 2014, NATURE CORRUPTION IN##Eicher S., 2009, CORRUPTION INT BUSIN##Ersson Svante, 1996, DEMOCRACY DEV, P45##Fardigh M.A., 2012, QUAL GOV I WORKC NIC##FORSON J.

The purpose of this paper is to review research in which Quality Management methods, tools or practices have been used in conjunction with sustainable development initiatives. We have identified four themes that synthesize the research on Quality Management and its support to approaches for sustainable development: (I) supporting sustainability through integration of management systems, (II) Quality Management as support to the implementation of Environmental Management Systems and to the management of sustainability, (III) supporting integration of sustainability considerations in daily work, and (IV) supporting stakeholder management and customer focus. By far the most research has been conducted within the first two themes. This paper also contributes with proposals for future research, such as the need to move beyond existing standards and management systems to enable more radical improvements, and the need for empirical evidence of the effect of integrated management systems on environmental performance. We also highlight the point that Quality Management practices and tools must be developed and adapted in order to support sustainability considerations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000388775100003",2017,"A framework for strategic sustainable development","The purpose of this paper is to give a comprehensive and cohesive description of the most recent version of the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD), and also to describe and discuss the overall method for developing the FSSD, elaborate on the general rational for and general benefits of a framework of this type, and Validate benefits of the FSSD through examples of its application. The purpose is also to point to pertinent future work. In preparation of this paper, we have reviewed previous publications and other documents related to the FSSD and reflected on the 25-year learning process between scientists and practitioners. We conclude that the FSSD has proven to aid organizations in thoroughly understanding and putting themselves in context of the global sustainability challenge, and to move themselves strategically towards sustainability, i.e., to stepwise reduce their negative impacts on ecological and social systems at large while strengthening the own organization through capturing of innovation opportunities, including new business models, exploration of new markets and winning of new market shares, and through reduced risks and operation costs. Specifically, we conclude that the FSSD aids more effective management of system boundaries and trade-offs, makes it possible to model and assess sustainable potentials for various materials and practices before investments are made, and offers the possibility for more effective collaboration across disciplines and sectors, regions, value-chains and stakeholder groups. We also conclude that the FSSD makes it possible to prevent damages, even from yet unknown problems, and not the least, to guide selection, development and combination of supplementary methods, tools, and other forms of support, which makes it possible to increase their utility for strategic sustainable development. Finally, we have shown that the FSSD is useful for structuring transdisciplinary academic education and research. Several examples of ongoing FSSD related research, as well as ideas for future work, are given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000388775100016",2017,"An approach to business model innovation and design for strategic sustainable development","Successful business is increasingly about understanding the challenges and opportunities linked to society's transition towards sustainability and, e.g., being able to innovate, design and build business models that are functional in this context. However, current business model innovation and design generally fails to sufficiently embrace the sustainability dimension. Typically, the business case of sustainability is not understood profoundly enough; the planning horizon and system scope are insufficient; the competence to bring together people into systematic ventures towards sustainable business is too low. A unifying framework for sustainability analyses, planning, cross-disciplinary and cross-sector cooperation, and cohesive use of the myriad sustainability tools, methods and concepts has been developed: the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD). Similarly, a generic approach to business model design has been put forward: the Business Model Canvas (BMC). In this paper we explore how the FSSD could inform business model innovation and design by combining it with the BMC and supplementary tools, methods and concepts such as creativity techniques, value network mapping, life-cycle assessment, and product-service systems. The results show that the FSSD-BMC combination can support business model innovation and design for strategic sustainable development, as well as strengthen each supplementary tool, method and concept in its own primary purpose. We apply the combined approach, for the purpose of initial testing and presentation, to a real case of business model evolution. Based on our findings we propose a new approach to business model innovation and design for strategic sustainable development. The new approach facilitates, e.g., business scalability and risk avoidance and clarifies the interplay between classical business model development and strategic sustainability thinking. The new approach highlights the opportunity for novel business model design for future sustainable success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The field of design has contributed to the creation of such complex socio-ecological problems, but it is also adapting as a source for solutions. Design Thinking (DT) was identified as a possible approach that could help create such solutions, and contribute to Strategic Sustainable Development (SSD). The purpose of the research was to examine potential contributors and hindrances of the DT process with regards to SSD, and create a prototype of an integrated process that could help achieve more strategic and sustainable outcomes. Using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) as a lens to examine and inform the above, combined with interviews, Action Research and expert feedback, an integrated process was created. It was indicated by participants of the Action Research and by experts that the proposed prototype could help reach strategic and sustainable outcomes, and that further refinement should be pursued. Consequently, a third and final prototype, suggesting a possible Sustainable Design Thinking (SDT) process, was developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000388826700028",2016,"Sustainability and sustainable development in engineering education","One of the challenges of this century is related to the perspective that the societies become socially, environmentally and economically sustainable in order to satisfy the needs of present generations without reducing the chances of the future generations to achieve theirs. It is through higher education that new professionals start acting, thus, influence how current and future generations deal with the social, environmental and economic issues, i.e., with the sustainability and the Sustainable Development (SD). So, it is responsibility of higher education to provide to the people competencies to enable them to deal with the technical and environmental challenges through solutions that minimize environmental impacts and social inequalities. As the engineers have direct relationship to the production of knowledge and technologies that directly impact society and the environment is essential that the engineering background allows them to design technologies and economic activities to sustain rather than degrade the natural environment and improve health and human well-being. In this context, this paper aims to reflect about the vision of sustainability/DS required for engineering education so that it may contribute to make sustainable societies.","COMPETENCES","Sustainability; Sustainable development; Engineering education","REVISTA ELETRONICA EM GESTAO EDUCACAO E TECNOLOGIA AMBIENTAL","Loureiro, SM##Pereira, VLDD##Pacheco, W","[Loureiro, Solange Maria; Duarte do Valle Pereira, Vera Lucia] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

"J","WOS:000389320300002",2016,"Geodesign dynamics for sustainable urban watershed development","Sustainable urban development is considered a complex problem. Geodesign applies systems thinking to such problems using a dynamic and collaborative process wherein iteration is necessary to address diverse objectives. Preparation and execution of a two-day research workshop explored two aspects of geodesign dynamics using a new software platform called GeodesignHub.com. One aspect of dynamics concerned the cross-systems influence of proposed projects and policies as related to ten systems (e.g. transportation, housing, surface water, forest preserves etc.) influencing watershed sustainability in King County, Washington. A second aspect investigated the interaction among six multi-disciplinary design teams and each pursuing different considerations in decision workflow processes. A decision workflow called the Steinitz Geodesign Framework was scoped, designed, and implemented to address meaningful and substantive policy and project proposals for achieving consensus on a 40-year plan design. Workshop participants addressed targets among ten subsystems for sustainable urban development. Findings suggest the software provided support for high-performance collaboration when teams moved toward their targets and when negotiating to achieve a single plan outcome, but the urban growth areas and or housing densities established through policy are likely in need of reconsideration to accommodate population growth.

"J","WOS:000390711100003",2016,"The interrelations between competences for sustainable development and research competences","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how competences for sustainable development and research interrelate within a context of competence-based higher education. Specific focus is oriented towards strengthening research competences for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Following a hermeneutic-interpretive methodology, this paper builds upon a critical literature review to demarcate the theoretical framework and an in-depth analysis of a case study exploring the interrelations between both types of competences. Findings - The paper discusses current issues in the integration of competences and explores the contribution of research-based methods to acquire competences for sustainable development. The analysis shows that research skills are often mentioned to contribute to this acquisition, though from a general perspective, or from the sidelines of the learning process. A holistic view on how both concepts are linked is missing. Research limitations/implications - First, the complex nature of competences and their integration in higher education could lead to difficulties in interpreting and analysing them. Second, the analysis is based on a single-case study, limiting possibilities to generalise the results. Third, this study is not looking at curriculum practices in these fields. Practical implications - There is a need to holistically (re-) frame research competences within the concepts of education for sustainable development and, to a wider extent, sustainable development. Social implications - Framing research competences within the concept of sustainable development enables a thorough and ""conscious"", rather than coincidental, acquisition of competences for sustainable development. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the fact that there is little literature about the interrelations between competences for sustainable development and research competences.","HIGHER-EDUCATION; POLICY DEVELOPMENT; KEY COMPETENCES; INTEGRATION; SUPPORT","Higher education; Education for sustainable development; Information literacy; Competences for sustainable development; Research competences","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Lambrechts, W##Van Petegem, P","[Lambrechts, Wim] Univ Antwerp, Dept Philosophy, Antwerp, Belgium.

However, none have explicitly focused on avenues toward sustainable development in terms of poverty eradication and achieving equitable resource allocation. This study seeks to empirically derive the challenges to sustainable development in Mississippi by forming clusters of counties with similar socioeconomic, demographic, health, and environmental characteristics. Maps created through ArcGIS software are used in conjunction with the cluster analysis to visualize the data. Cluster analysis yielded three distinct clusters. Priority should be given to counties that are predominantly black, rural, and characterized by high unemployment and high poverty. Special attention should also be implemented in counties characterized by a high unmet need for health services and a low density of medical professionals.",NA,"Cluster analysis; GIS; Mississippi; sustainable development","COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT","Liew, H","[Liew, Hui] Delta State Univ, Div Social Sci & Hist, Cleveland, MS 38733 USA.","Development Studies","Development Studies","Barton AW, 2010, COMMUNITY DEV, V41, P298, DOI 10.1080/15575330903444051##Bearden C., 2004, RURAL VIABILITY INDE##Bradshaw T.K., 2000, COMMUNITY DEV, V31, P112, DOI [DOI 10.1080/15575330009489735, 10.1080/15575330009489735]##Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), WOULD MED EXP AFF MI##Gent JF, 2009, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V117, P1168, DOI 10.1289/ehp.0800335##Hart M., 1998, TRADITIONAL VS SUSTA##Harvey MH, 2013, COMMUNITY DEV, V44, P257, DOI 10.1080/15575330.2012.734840##Hill Marianne, 2008, EC STATUS AFRICAN AM##Holland JH, 2015, COMMUNITY DEV, V46, P67, DOI 10.1080/15575330.2014.991410##Kenney G.M., 2012, OPTING MED EXPANSION##Khattree R, 2000, MULTIVARIATE DATA RE, P393##Kundzewicz ZW, 1997, HYDROLOG SCI J, V42, P467, DOI 10.1080/02626669709492047##Lichter DT, 2012, RURAL SOCIOL, V77, P3, DOI 10.1111/j.1549-0831.2012.00070.x##Moss ML, 2010, COMMUNITY DEV, V41, P240, DOI 10.1080/15575330903477309##MYERS MF, 1993, ENVIRONMENT, V35, P6, DOI 10.1080/00139157.1993.9929131##Neal B., 2012, FISCAL EC IMPACTS ME##Orru H, 2009, ENVIRON HEALTH-GLOB, V8, DOI 10.1186/1476-069X-8-7##Phillips R., 2004, COMMUNITY DEV J, V39, P112##PUTNAM R, 2001, CANADIAN J POLICY RE, V2, P41, DOI DOI 10.1002/SMJ.249##Repetto R., 1986, WORLD ENOUGH TIME SU##Richardson JA, 2007, COMMUNITY DEV, V38, P92, DOI 10.1080/15575330709490187##Roberts Brandon, 2012, LOW INCOME WORKING F##Rogers P.K., 2007, INTRO SUSTAINABLE DE##Sampson RJ, 1999, AM SOCIOL REV, V64, P633, DOI 10.2307/2657367##Sanhueza PA, 2009, J AIR WASTE MANAGE, V59, P1481, DOI 10.3155/1047-3289.59.12.1481##Shaffer R., 2009, COMMUNITY DEV, V26, P145, DOI [10.1080/15575339509489856, DOI 10.1080/15575339509489856]##STEIN AD, 1995, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V141, P1097, DOI 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117375##Taylor DF, 2010, COMMUNITY DEV, V41, P108, DOI 10.1080/15575330903548778##U.

What is critically important to underscore is the value of the site to society. Design/methodology/approach - The relevant data were collected through questionnaires, personal interviews and site visits. Findings - The paper reveals that cultural heritage has affected sustainable development of local communities living in its vicinity in social and cultural terms. There is promotion of Shona traditions through exhibitions and selling of curios by local people at community projects such as the Shona Village and the Great Zimbabwe Nemanwa Craft Centre. The two projects also generate revenue to the local communities. However it was established that a number of benefits from the site such as employment creation are temporary and unsustainable. The main challenge for effecting sustainable development to local communities is lack of community participation. Originality/value - Most researchers are arguing that sustainability of cultural heritage is much more difficult compared to natural heritage but the findings reflect that cultural heritage through Great Zimbabwe World Heritage Site could be an essential engine and valuable resource for sustainable development.",NA,"Cultural heritage; Sustainable development; Zimbabwe; Local community; Great Zimbabwe World Heritage Site","JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Macheka, MT","[Macheka, Mavis Thokozile] Great Zimbabwe Univ, Acad Registry, Masvingo, Zimbabwe.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology","Science & Technology - Other Topics","Appiah A.

One is new, the other is old. In fact, a gap of thirty years separates Strategic Niche Management (SNM) from the Alternative Technology movement (AT), yet both share a niche-based perspective on change. Their core approach is to generate knowledge and disseminate lessons about sustainable technological practices through innovative, bottom-up activities. The ambition for both is to seed a sustainable transformation of incumbent technological regimes. SNM proves to be more managerial in its approach; while AT conceptualises niches as a much more grassroots activity. This reflects their different histories. Comparisons between the two uncover some fundamental issues regarding alternative technology niches and sustainable development.","PROSPECTS","alternative technology; strategic niche management; grassroots innovation; sustainable development; technology policy","Innovation-Management Policy & Practice","Smith, A","[Smith, Adrian] Univ Sussex, Policy Res Unit, SPRU Sci & Technol, Brighton, E Sussex, England.","Management","Business & Economics","Berkhout F, 2002, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V12, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0959-3780(01)00025-5##Berkhout F., 2003, SPRU ELECT WORKING P, V106##Boyle G., 1976, RADICAL TECHNOLOGY##Clarke R., 1973, NEW SCI##Dickson D., 1974, ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLO##Douthwaite B., 2002, ENABLING INNOVATION##Dunphy D, 1996, HUM RELAT, V49, P541, DOI 10.1177/001872679604900501##Ecologist, 1972, BLUEPR SURV##Elliott D., 1984, AT IN THE 18##Freeman C., 1991, SCI PUBL POLICY, V18, P407##Geels F.

"J","WOS:000392908400008",2017,"Sustainable Development of a City: Systemic Approach","Today the concept of sustainable development has been adopted as a basis for promoting development at all levels of territorial organisation. While generally worked out for the global level, this conception has also attained a local dimension, after the local Agenda 21 had been drawn up at the Rio conference in 1992. However, each level of development planning has its own specific features, and so have individual territorial units at that level. This also, or perhaps primarily, concerns cities because of wide differences in their sizes, the complexity of relations occurring there, the accumulation of development problems, the special role they play in the settlement system and difficulties with transferring the assumptions of a conception worked out for the global scale to the local level. This paper seeks to find a way of understanding sustainable development appropriate to the specificity of a city, with special attention paid to a systemic conception, and more specifically that of a territorial social system. Also, an analysis is made of selected conceptions and models indicating concrete measures that should be taken to make urban development more balanced, especially in its spatial aspect. The reflections lead to the conclusion that sustainable urban development can hardly be associated with the sustainability presented in the report Our Common Future; rather, it should involve a search for conditions of a city's intra- and inter-system balance and relations with its immediate and farther vicinity.",NA,"city; urban system; sustainable development; territorial social system; sustainable development model and conceptions","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Mierzejewska, L","[Mierzejewska, Lidia] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Socioecon Geog & Spatial Management, Ul Dziegielowa 27, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Borys T., 1999, WSKAZNIKI EKOROZWOJU##Bugge H.C., 2003, GEORGETOWN INT ENV L, V15, P359##Chojnicki Z., 1989, PRZEGLAD GEOGRAFICZY, V60, P491##Chojnicki Z., 1999, PODSTAWY METODOLOGIC##Domanski R., 2006, GEOGRAFIA EKONOMICZN##GIBBS D., 2000, GEOFORUM, V31##GIRADET H, 1992, CITIES NEW DIRECTION##GIRADET H., 1993, REGENERATING CITIES, V6, P37##Haughton Graham, 1997, CITIES, V14##HEINBERG R., 2010, WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE##Jenks M, 2010, FUTURE CITY, V2, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-8647-2_1##KOGLIN T., 2009, B LUND U##KOWALEWSKI A.T., 2005, NAUKA, V1, P123##MIERZEJEWSKA L., 2006, POLITYKA ZROWNOWAZON, P11##Mierzejewska L., 2009, QUESTIONES GEOGRAPHI, V28, P29##NAESS P., 2001, EUROPEAN PLANNING ST, V9, P504##Nijkamp P, 2008, ROMANIAN J REGIONAL, V2, P1##NORGAARD RB, 1989, ECOL ECON, V1, P37##Olewiler N, 2006, CITIES, V23, P184, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2006.03.006##OSELAND M., 1997, CITIES, V14##Petrisor A.I., 2013, PRESENT ENV SUST DEV, V7, P268##Pincetl S, 2012, CITIES, V29, pS32, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2012.06.009##Satterthwaite D, 1997, URBAN STUD, V34, P1667, DOI 10.1080/0042098975394##Sneddon C, 2006, ECOL ECON, V57, P253, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.04.013##Vojnovic I, 2014, CITIES, V41, pS30, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2014.06.002##Wong SW, 2005, CITIES, V22, P303, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2005.05.008##World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE",11,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM5","no","SDG.11#SDG.8"
"J","WOS:000393656500006",2017,"Sustainable Mobility for the Future: Development and Implementation of a Sustainable Transportation Planning Course","The field of transportation engineering has become more sustainable as challenges of the twenty-first century continue. Sustainable mobility topics such as pedestrian and cycling travel, smart growth development, and transit-oriented design are being adopted and implemented. As a result, there is the need for higher-education curriculum on transportation engineering to adapt as well. Efforts to integrate sustainable and multimodal design into introductory transportation courses have emerged, as well as new courses in the transportation field. This paper describes the development and implementation of an upper-level course, Sustainable Transportation Planning, at Bucknell University. Course objectives, pedagogical tools, activities, and assessment methods are discussed in depth to provide insight into how other institutions can adopt a similar course. An emphasis is placed on active learning techniques and the need to balance the three components of sustainability (environment, economy, and society) into the course material. Courses such as this can expose students to transportation planning challenges and inspire them to pursue careers in sustainable transportation.

Governance is capable of common sense and the versatile planning that is required for sustainable development. In the literature, the relationship between governance and sustainability has been empirically examined in terms of the rule of law, bureaucratic quality and corruption. However, governance is a versatile variable that contains such variables as pluralism, accountability, political stability and the absence of violence and government effectiveness. According to the results from estimates obtained in the study, governance has an important and positive effect on sustainable development. This powerful effect applies to all developed and developing countries. Thus, to prevent resources from becoming scarce, countries should increase their governance levels.

The specific concept of culturally sustainable development (CSD), first promulgated more than 20years ago, is re-assessed in the light of contemporary circumstances as a theoretically plausible proposition and as a basis for application to cultural policy formation. The paper proposes a set of principles by which consistency of a cultural policy or cultural development strategy with CSD can be judged. The application of each of the principles is discussed, drawing illustrations from particular policy areas in both developed and developing countries. The paper argues that CSD is a concept that has both theoretical substance and potential for practical policy application.","CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; GOODS","Sustainable development; ESD; sustainable development goals; cultural sustainability; culturally sustainable development","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL POLICY","Throsby, D","[Throsby, David] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","Cultural Studies","Cultural Studies","Aga Khan Trust for Culture, 2005, AL AZH PARK CAIR REV##Alper N.

In response to variations in concepts and frameworks used in advocacy, policy, and academia, we propose four roles cultural policy can play towards sustainable development: first, to safeguard and sustain cultural practices and rights; second, to green' the operations and impacts of cultural organizations and industries; third, to raise awareness and catalyse actions about sustainability and climate change; and fourth, to foster ecological citizenship'. The challenge for cultural policy is to help forge and guide actions along these co-existing and overlapping strategic paths towards sustainable development.",NA,"Sustainable development; cultural policy; cultural sustainability; culture and sustainability; sustainable development goals; UNESCO","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL POLICY","Duxbury, N##Kangas, A##De Beukelaer, C","[Duxbury, Nancy] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal.

"J","WOS:000396607200002",2017,"Responsibility and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals","This article asks what key concerns emerge from the way responsibility is framed in United Nations summit documents on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015. Our conceptual framework serves to make the study of SDG responsibility more systematic by distinguishing three main senses of responsibility: cause, obligation, and accountability. The framework structures our analysis of two SDG summit documents, Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The article shows, first, that the causal sense of responsibility is hidden between the lines in paragraphs on poverty, debt and environmental issues. As a consequence, root causes of problems might not be appropriately addressed. Second, SDG summit documents deal predominantly with responsibility in the sense of obligation. We raise concerns with repeated consideration for national circumstances and with vague obligations for non-governmental actors. Third, with regard to accountability, we stress that quantitative indicators have unintended steering effects both before and beyond the review phase. The focus on indicators risks shadowing broader obligations, such as international human rights. In all its three senses, responsibility in key SDG documents remains statecentric with great room for state sovereignty, self-regulation and respect for national circumstances. Our framework is useful also in showing that the three senses of responsibility build on each other and that engagement with responsibility provides fruitful ground for further research.","DEVELOPMENT AGENDA; GLOBAL JUSTICE; ACCOUNTABILITY; GOVERNANCE","responsibility; accountability; sustainable development goals; United Nations","FORUM FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES","Bexell, M##Jonsson, K","[Bexell, Magdalena; Jonsson, Kristina] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lund, Sweden.","Development Studies","Development Studies","Barry C, 2003, GLOB ISS SER, P218##Bellamy AJ, 2015, ETHICS INT AFF, V29, P161, DOI 10.1017/S0892679415000052##Berensmann K., 2015, TRANSLATING AMBITIOU##Cane Peter, 2002, RESPONSIBILITY LAW M##Chasek PS, 2016, REV EUR COMP INT ENV, V25, P5, DOI 10.1111/reel.12149##Donald K, 2016, ETHICS INT AFF, V30, P201, DOI 10.1017/S0892679416000083##Erskine T, 2003, GLOBAL ISSUES, P19##Fearon J.

Next, sustainable development indicators, selected for the analysis, are characterized in accordance with the approach to sustainable development level measurement adopted by the European Union. The synthetic measure of development (SMD) was applied as the research method, the data for calculations were collected from The World Bank resources. The research results presenting values of particular indicators in the studied years and the values of SMD constitute the core of the study.

The main pillars of sustainable development, such as political, socio-economic, ecological, health and demographic were analyzed in space-time dimension. Ukraine declares compliance with the sustainable development principles and aims to change towards the implementation of this social ideology, however, in reality the implementation of sustainable development concepts is occurring very slowly and unsystematically. Therefore, Ukraine on its way to sustainable development and inclusive development is facing a complex range of typical and untypical social problems. A certain uniqueness of the situation and the geopolitical importance of Ukraine constantly puts in the spotlight the question of its support on the way to sustainable development on behalf of democratic countries. However, this support should be encouraged by the Ukrainian population consolidation towards the democratic choice and the decisive actions of the Ukrainian government towards the reforms recently implemented in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to overcome the legacy of the authoritarian regimes.","TRANSITION; STATE","sustainable development; inclusive development; Ukraine","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Pantyley, V##Lozynskyy, R##Slyvka, R","[Pantyley, Viktoriya] Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Fac Earth Sci & Spatial Management, Dept Socioecon Geog, Krasnicka 2 Cd, PL-20718 Lublin, Poland.

In particular, SDGs' goal 5, ""Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls"" (UN 2016). However, persistently high gender gap was found in many countries around the world whether they are developed or developing. The 2016 Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), which examines gender inequality across four key areas of health, education, economy and politics, showed that the gender gap widened in many countries, and the gap in ""economic participation and opportunity"" showed the largest gender gap compared to health, education and political participation (World Economic Forum 2016). Interestingly, the GGGI do not match the global ranking of countries based on their GDP size, GDP per capita, or even the level of poverty. Thus, in order to deal with the underlying causes of deep-rooted and persistent gender inequality we must develop more culturally nuanced and contextualized approaches in the SDGs to tackle gender inequality (Song & Kim 2013). Gender inequality is simply not acceptable in the world where half of the world's citizens are not provided with the same rights as the other half. It is also economically less productive to rely on only half of the world's labor force to help eradicate poverty. Education, employment, and full empowerment of women and girls must be a priority for the SDGs.","SOUTH-KOREA; MORTALITY; HEALTH","Sustainable Development Goals; gender; empowerment; inequality; UN","GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY","Kim, EM","[Kim, Eun Mee] Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.

The paper describes the manner in which sustainable development principles have been distorted over time and the need for an enrichment of the concept with original ideas based on safety and rationality in development that would lead to an actual consideration of individual welfare. To this end, safety and rationality components are described, as they are regarded as requirements of sustainable development, and the rationality component is further analyzed. The methodology allows the building of an index of rationality for the 2007-2013 research interval, which attempts to capture the complexity of the rationality dimension of sustainability. The index of rationality is applied to specific circumstances from different countries and is used on a cross-country analysis to determine the progress of the member states of the European Union on the sustainability road.

By attempting to cover all that is good and desirable in society, these targets have ended up as vague, weak, or meaningless. We suggest a model for sustainable development based on three moral imperatives: satisfying human needs, ensuring social equity, and respecting environmental limits. The model reflects Our Common Future's central message, moral imperatives laid out in philosophical texts on needs and equity, and recent scientific insights on environmental limits. The model is in conflict with the popular three-pillar model of sustainable development, which seeks to balance social, environmental, and economic targets. Rather, we argue that sustainable development constitutes a set of constraints on human behaviour, including constraints on economic activity. By identifying indicators, and thresholds, we illustrate that different regions or groups of countries face different challenges.

In meeting those goals, it is important to also ensure that such efforts are socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. To draw lessons for this new wave of development finance, this article conducts a comparative analysis of social and environmental safeguards across international development banks. We find a significant divergence in safeguard policy across development banks operating in the region, with Western-backed development banks requiring that borrowers harmonize to developed country standards to others such as China's and Brazil's banks deferring to host country standards. On the basis of this research, we develop a framework that allows analysts to better empirically examine the impact of different safeguard regimes on environment, social, and development outcomes.","ROADS","development banks; environment and social safeguards; Latin America; green finance; sustainable development","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT","Gallagher, KP##Yuan, F","[Gallagher, Kevin P.] Boston Univ, Pardee Sch Global Studies, Global Dev Policy, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

Sustainable economic growth is demanded by regions and countries with urbanization globally. Chenshan has played an important role in the sustainable development of Shanghai as a relatively newly established botanical garden. Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden works closely with the local government in the ""City Green Master Plan"" to increase plant diversity and join in rural park projects. It also provides technical support to city construction by introducing urban horticulture and phytoremediation. More than 20% of the plants in the most urbanized and industrialized areas in China are under threat. Chenshan has collaborated with the central government and the administration of local reserves in the conservation of 14 critically endangered plant species in East China. This has made the sustainable utilization of these plants possible. Chenshan also has a strategic vision to provide people with functional food. The secondary metabolism and gene-manipulating platforms have been already implemented to develop new varieties of plants to achieve this goal. As a botanical garden, Chenshan aims to attract and educate the public with landscapes, seasonal flower shows, and cultural events. Chenshan helps visitors understand the condition of plants and the ways to protect them. These are important tasks of botanical gardens in supporting sustainable urban development.",NA,"Botanicalarden; horticultural technique; sustainable development","ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN","Hu, YH##Vincent, G##Chen, XY","[Hu, Yonghong; Vincent, Gilles; Chen, Xiaoya] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Chenshan Bot Garden, Shanghai Chenshan Plant Sci Res Ctr, Shanghai Key Lab Plant Funct Genom & Resources, Shanghai 201602, Peoples R China.","Plant Sciences","Plant Sciences","Gagnon V, 2013, ECOL ENG, V61, P593, DOI 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.02.017##Griggs D, 2013, NATURE, V495, P305, DOI 10.1038/495305a##Ladislas S, 2013, WATER AIR SOIL POLL, V224, DOI 10.1007/s11270-012-1408-x##Shang H, 2016, J SYST EVOL, V54, P528, DOI 10.1111/jse.12205##Shanghai Local Government, 2016, SHANGH MAST PLAN 201##UN, 2015, TRANSF OUR WORLD 203##Yang L, 2016, SCI BULL, V61, P3, DOI 10.1007/s11434-015-0929-2##Yang L, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0080464##Yu J, 2016, TREE GENET GENOMES, V12, P90##Yu SY, 2016, SCI REP-UK, V6, DOI 10.1038/srep26944##Yuan JH, 2014, MOL ECOL, V23, P82, DOI 10.1111/mec.12567##Zhao Q, 2016, SCI BULL, V61, P1391, DOI 10.1007/s11434-016-1136-5##Zhao Q, 2016, SCI ADV, V2, DOI 10.1126/sciadv.1501780",4,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM4","no","SDG.11#SDG.4"

In fact, one of the targets for the Sustainable Development Goals announced by the United Nations in September 2015 aims to ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, thorough education on sustainable development. The current study focuses on the evaluation of individual works based on the sustainable development suggested to students in a subject of the Master's of Thermal Engineering at the University of Vigo. In addition, a sustainable holistic rubric is presented, which was used to analyze the ability of the students to incorporate sustainability principles in their work. The rubric was based on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the associated targets of the United Nations, more specifically on the Goals 7, 8, 12, and 13. A total of 10 works were evaluated. As a general conclusion, it was found that the students generally do not consider or consider to a lower extent the economic criteria opposite to the environmental, technical, and social dimensions. The environmental sub-criterion were applied to a greater extent in the development of the works. However, the technical and social dimensions were included to a greater or lesser extent depending on the type of work developed.",NA,"sustainable development; high education; Sustainable Development Goals; environmental criteria; technical criteria; economic criteria; social criteria; rubric","SUSTAINABILITY","Crespo, B##Miguez-Alvarez, C##Arce, ME##Cuevas, M##Miguez, JL","[Crespo, Barbara; Luis Miguez, Jose] Univ Vigo, Sch Ind Engn, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain.

Research Design & Methods: A review of mainstream literature on Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs) was conducted along with document-based descriptive analysis of secondary data and further critical literature analysis. Statistical databases have been used for the analysis. Findings: This research paper draws on several strands within the economic, social, environmental, as well as the institutional and political dimensions of sustainability measurement. The results indicate that Polish monitoring system of sustainable development is based on numerous strategic documents. There is no integrated strategy of sustainable development in Poland. The findings also suggest SDI structure has been dominated by social indicators. Implications & Recommendations: The evaluation of the Polish measurement system can help to find solutions that support change processes aimed at improving the implementation of sustainable development principles in policy making. Contribution & Value Added: This article contributes to existing literature on measurement and monitoring of sustainable development by applying SDIs in the public statistics as well as in the practices of decision-making at policy level. Overall, this study extends the understanding of the importance of SDIs and implications of measurement by focusing on the importance of the sustainable development areas.",NA,"sustainable development; sustainable development strategy; indicator; measuring; monitoring progress","ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS REVIEW","Urbaniec, M","[Urbaniec, Maria] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Krakow, Poland.","Economics","Business & Economics","[Anonymous], ZASADACH PROWADZENIA##[Anonymous], 2013, DLUG STRAT ROZW KRAJ##[Anonymous], 1997, KONSTYTUCJA RZECZYPO##[Anonymous], PLANOWANIU ZAGOSPODA##Atkinson G., 2007, ENCY LIFE SUPPORT SY, P195##Boni M., 2009, WYZWANIA ROZWOJOWE Z##Borys T., 2005, WSKAZNIKI ZROWNOWAZO, P62##Borys T., 2008, RACHUNKI NARODOWE WY, P115##Borys T, 2011, PROBL EKOROZW, V6, P75##Burchard-Dziubinska M., 2014, ZROWNOWAZONY ROZWOJ, P9##Central Statistical Office, 2011, SUST DEV IND POL##Central Statistical Office, 2014, SYST MON ROZW##Central Statistical Office, 2014, BANK DAN LOK MOD WSK##Cizmowska A, 2012, PROBL EKOROZW, V7, P51##Commission of the European Communities, 2009, 2009 REV EUR UN STR##COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 2006, REN EU SUST DEV STRA##Czaja S., 2009, ZROWNOWAZONY ROZWOJ, P190##EC (European Commission), 2010, STRAT SMART SUST INC##European Commision, 2009, SUST DEV EUR UN 2009##European Commission, 2014, EUR SUST DEV IND##European Union, 2013, SUST DEV EUR UN 2013##Famielec J., 2009, WPLYW IDEI ZROWNOWAZ, VI, P36##Fiedor B., 2013, HANDEL WEWNETRZNY, V1, P7##Ghosh N., 2014, SUSTAINABILITY SCI S, DOI [10.4018/978-1-4666-4995-8, DOI 10.4018/978-1-4666-4995-8]##Jager J., 2009, BACKGROUND PAPER PRE##Levin S.

The influence of global economic and social processes is likewise ensuring that South American rural mountainous areas are more likely to join up the global networks via which goods are distributed and traded. However, many difficulties and barriers have been met with on the way, and these will need to be dealt with at the local level. Since the 1980s, rural environment in South America has experienced major changes, and these changes have been brought about by the need to adjust political strategies to new global conditions of sustainable development. New strategies of development adopted by inhabitants and political elites have not always proved effective in the face of long-term neglection over the integration of local markets for small producers with their national and international counterparts, and this generates a situation in which local agricultural markets find themselves in circumstances of neglect and uncertainty. So, how can sustainable development strategy be performed in this situation?","VULNERABILITY","sustainable rural development; development barriers; South America; Peru; social periphery","JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING","Czerny, M##Aguilar, HC##Czerny, A##Rzucidlo, A","[Czerny, Miroslawa] Univ Warsaw, Fac Geog & Reg Studies, Warsaw, Poland.

Previous researchers put these pillars as economy, social and environment. Upon improving these three pillars, sustainable development becomes trustworthy in relation to workplace safety and health improvement. However, the researchers' findings have drawback in considering existing three pillars. Previous researches neglected to incorporate the other three pillars of sustainable development which are culture, political and technological factors. Having these pillars, sustainable development can also be guaranteed by considering workplace safety and health innovation for all internal and external entities engage at work. This is because of the implementation the pillars reduce the working environment accidents and disease. Hence, this research focuses on the workplace safety & health innovation, introducing new pillars for sustainable development, their impact on sustainable developments and indicating the three pillars future research areas. Methods like literature review, interviewing employees and observation of industries were used. There were few researches found on how sustainable development affected by workplace safety and health innovation approaches. However, this literature more focused on the relationship workplace innovation and sustainable development share in common. The other finding in this study showed that the innovation of workplace safety and health brings sustainable development through healthy people, safer workplace, reduced cost of accidents, controlled environment, managed workplace accidents and improved workplace safety knowledge. The researchers have also attempted to forward roads toward sustainable development through occupational safety and health innovation and improvement approaches. (C) 2016 Karabuk University.

Critical voices such as the International Council for Science (ICSU), however, have expressed concerns about the potential incompatibility of the SDGs, specifically the incompatibility of socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. In this paper, we test, quantify and model the alleged inconsistency of SDGs. Our analyses show which SDGs are consistent and which are conflicting. We measure the extent of inconsistency and conclude that the SDG agenda will fail as a whole if we continue with business as usual. We further explore the nature of the inconsistencies using dynamical systems models, which reveal that the focus on economic growth and consumption as a means for development underlies the inconsistency. Our models also show that there are factors which can contribute to development (health programmes, government investment) on the one hand and ecological sustainability (renewable energy) on the other, without triggering the conflict between incompatible SDGs.","ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CONSUMPTION; DEGRADATION","Sustainable development goals; sustainable development; dynamical systems modelling; factor analysis; feature selection; UN data revolution","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Spaiser, V##Ranganathan, S##Swain, RB##Sumpter, DJT","[Spaiser, Viktoria] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.

The aim of this article is to offer a reasoned justification of the evolution of the concept of development and of the need for an educational commitment to be able to make progress towards it. Although it is still polemical and the object of criticism, SHD has become consolidated as a strongly ethical proposal to lead the change in the course of development, transversally affecting its multiple dimensions and advocating interdisciplinary and intercultural cooperation and dialogue. The article analyses the challenges posed by SHD to today's global society, as well as some ways to respond to them from the field of educational action and research. It concludes with a reasoned structuring of the contents of the monograph and an analytical description of the contents of the different contributions.","SCIENCE","crisis of civilization; sustainable human development; educational challenges; culture of sustainability; education for sustainable development","TEORIA DE LA EDUCACION","Minguet, PA##Ruiz, AB","[Aznar Minguet, Pilar] Univ Valencia, Fac Filosofia & Ciencies Educ, Dept Teoria Educ, Avda Blasco Ibanez 30, Valencia 46010, Spain.

"J","WOS:000411544400078",2017,"Towards sustainable development through the perspective of eco-efficiency - A systematic literature review","Sustainability concerns have increasingly gained importance among organizations and their stakeholders around the world. In this context, eco-efficiency has become a consistent tool towards the transition to sustainable development and the efforts of eco-efficiency indicators have been used for comparative studies and decision-making tasks, providing better financial, environmental, and social performance. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review on the theme of sustainable development from the perspective of eco-efficiency, with the adaptation of the Knowledge Development Process intervention instrument - constructivist (ProKnow-C). The paper identifies and structures the state-of-the-art between Eco-Efficiency and Sustainable Development with a view to: (i) selecting a Bibliographic Portfolio (BP) that is aligned with the perception of the researchers on the theme; (ii) performing a bibliometric analysis of the selected BP; (iii) performing a thematic synthesis; (iv) finding the integration of eco-efficiency and sustainable development with other approaches; (v) proposing an innovative framework to achieve sustainable development through eco-efficiency indicators; and (vi) finding paths for further research. This research makes multiple new contributions, providing both academics and practitioners a better panorama to achieve sustainable development through eco-efficiency by expanding the literature review, highlighting the synergies and barriers between eco-efficiency and sustainable development and by comparing and analysing them, showing its relevant features. In addition, we synthesized the contributions of the BP according to the BASF indicators, sustainable dimensions and four measurement levels: industry, organization, project and process to better describe the current academic scenario on the subject.

Historical experience shows that, in the past, it has significantly contributed to the stability and development of many local communities. However, it can still be useful. The purpose of this article is to compare the benefits of the common good with the objectives of sustainable development. The common good can be evaluated in two ways, as a product or process. The first of these ways is based on an analysis of the characteristics of the good, and the other one on the processes supporting its creation. Product approach is more common in economic theory, but a process analysis of the common good is more adequate to indicate its significant advantages in the context of sustainable development. The results obtained indicate that the described solution can be successfully applied in the framework of the concept of sustainable development. In most cases, this is due to the integration of the social and economic needs of society. In some cases, environmental aspects can also cause a lot of benefits.

They were developed during 2015-2016 in the context of international technical help project ""The Support of Regional and Local Development in Belarus"" financed by the European Union. The main goal is to promote consistent changes in the management of regional and local development based on the strategies for sustainable regional development. The mentioned approaches are a body of principles, methods, methodic, directions, which provide economic efficiency, social justice and ecological security on the republican, regional and local levels through consensus, coherence of interests and coordination of central and local governments, as well as population, business structures, civil society institutions. These approaches considered, there were developed six strategies for sustainable development in the regions of the Republic of Belarus. However, the absence of legal and institutional basis complicates the practical implementation of the mentioned findings. Additionally, the advantages of inclusive management and information technologies while providing public services are not accounted for fully. We suppose that during further planning of sustainable development specific attention should be paid to its key aspects, the specifics of the Belarusian legal system and the broad information campaign. It is relevant in Belarus to develop a set of measures to implement sustainable regional development strategies, which also include access to basic electronic public services to all the sections of the population. It is also important to note that European migration processes influence the Republic of Belarus, therefore for the purpose of promoting ordered, safe and legal mobility we should return to the question of developing multiple nationality institute.",NA,"sustainable development; digital public services; digital divide; multiple nationality; local government; Republic of Belarus","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Sidorchuk, I##Akhrymenka, A##Shmakova, O##Grigoriev, A##Parfenchyk, A##Kulai, O","[Sidorchuk, Irina] Acad Publ Adm, State Adm Theory & Practice Res Inst, Minsk, BELARUS.

The sector can make significant contributions to the achievement of a large number of these Goals. Managing extractive resources has always presented a major challenge for many countries worldwide, but especially in the developing world. This paper documents the shortcomings of the existing governance architecture. It builds on the 'social licence to operate' and draws from its limitations to propose a new framework called the 'sustainable development licence to operate'. The latter is a holistic multilevel and multi-stakeholder governance framework aimed at enhancing the contribution of the mining sector to sustainable development. It is not intended to function as a licence in the regulatory sense. The underlying principles, policy options and best practices that form the basis of the proposed framework are outlined in the paper. This analysis should be viewed as a starting point, in recognition that the development of a robust sustainable development licence to operate depends on an open and inclusive approach to populating its normative content.","TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS; SOCIAL LICENSE","Extractive sector; Mining; Governance; Resource curse; Sustainable development goals; Social licence to operate; Sustainable development licence to operate","MINERAL ECONOMICS","Pedro, A##Ayuk, ET##Bodouroglou, C##Milligan, B##Ekins, P##Oberle, B","[Pedro, Antonio] United Nations Econ Commiss Africa, Yaounde, Cameroon.

A number of approaches have been proposed to understand or even manage the complex societal transition processes towards sustainable development. There are four popular approaches for sustainability transitions, i.e. the multi-phase concept, multi-level perspective, strategic niche management and transition management. However, there is a lack of studies to systematically review and critically reflect on these various approaches in this emerging field. This paper presents a holistic review of the four most common approaches, and more importantly identifies four critical challenges for the future studies on transition approaches. Consequently, the associated future research agenda is presented.

"J","WOS:000413743200008",2017,"Disruptions in strategic infrastructure planning - What do they mean for sustainable development?","The vision of sustainable development remains difficult to realize in practice. Processes of strategic planning for public infrastructure represent a major challenge, as, in many cases, they return unsustainable investment solutions. Research offers certain planning methodologies to improve the prospects of sustainable investments. However, very little is understood about how planning processes are undertaken in practice, and what problems in the procedural aspects of planning - termed planning disruptions in this paper - lead to deviations from the vision of sustainable development in infrastructure investments. This study scrutinizes the current scope of planning methodologies through the empirical case of a water supply augmentation in Melbourne, Australia.

"J","WOS:000413889400002",2017,"Accounting and sustainable development: Reflections and propositions","This paper emerges from an invitation to reflect upon the achievements of social and environmental accounting as well as to identify the challenges that lie ahead as the field continues its engagement with the goal of sustainable development. Three perspectives are developed in pursuit of that aim, namely: exploring the nature of the issues and mode of academic inquiry that is 'fit for purpose' given the demands of sustainable development; considering if a de-centring of accounting and the embrace of more holistic versions of accountability would be productive for future scholarship; and an exploration of how we might conceptualise 'engagement' with practice in this context (and what is meant by practice and practitioner). Taken together, this paper seeks to provide points of provocation and encouragement to social and environmental accountants, critical accounting scholars and to those seeking to understand sustainable development scholarship and action.

"J","WOS:000414331600008",2017,"Multilateral Development Banks and Sustainable Development: On Emulation, Fragmentation and a Common Law of Sustainable Development","Multilateral Development Banks (hereinafter MDBs) have evolved from avoiding non-economic considerations, as required in most of their charters, to officially supporting sustainable development. This transformation is due not only to international law, civil society pressure or internal adjustments, but in part to the emulation phenomenon between the international effort for sustainable development made by international conferences and commissions and the sustainable development effort by MDBs. The paper first examines this emulation phenomenon and its strong impact on MDB creation of substantive instruments - the environmental and social safeguards - and of procedural instruments - the accountability mechanisms - for the integration of sustainable development. Following this discussion, the second part points out that MDBs' environmental and social safeguards still differ substantially, revealing a fragmentation in MDBs' normative understanding of sustainable development. After presenting the arguments supporting this fragmentation, the last part of the paper argues in favor of the harmonization of MDBs' environmental and social safeguards, resulting in the creation of a common law of sustainable development, the promotion of international law and the facilitation of investments.",NA,"Multilateral Development Banks; sustainable development; social and environmental safeguards; accountability mechanisms; conditionality; fragmentation; harmonization","LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW","Mbengue, MM##de Moerloose, S","[Mbengue, Makane Moise; de Moerloose, Stephanie] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.

"J","WOS:000415331600018",2017,"Groundwater and human development: synergies and trade-offs within the context of the sustainable development goals","This article argues that groundwater-accounting for 98% of all fresh water on earth-is central to human development. Drawing upon studies at the regional and sub-regional level, this review article explores synergies and trade-offs between groundwater development and human development. On one hand, groundwater exploitation may enhance human development. Groundwater's ""untapped potential"" related to various aspects of human development involves (a) water supply for irrigation and domestic purposes; (b) climate change adaptation and hydrological resilience; (c) hydrogeological storage of CO2; and (d) access to (renewable) energy. On the other hand, human development may come at the expense of quality deterioration or depletion of groundwater. The review concludes that achieving a sound understanding of local groundwater characteristics and human impact on groundwater resources across scales is paramount to implementing the sustainable development goals in an integrated manner.","CLIMATE-CHANGE; CO2 STORAGE; WATER; IRRIGATION; IMPACTS; URBAN; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; COUNTRIES; SECURITY","Groundwater; Sustainable development; Human development; Synergies; Trade-offs","SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE","Velis, M##Conti, KI##Biermann, F","[Velis, Maya; Biermann, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.

"J","WOS:000415887800003",2017,"Constructing definitions of sustainable development","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ask how two normative definitions of sustainable development identified in the Brundtland report contribute to individual definitions constructed by a network of professional actors working in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on 74 questionnaires generated from a purposive sample of professional actors working in the construction sector. These questionnaires are analysed using a coding strategy based on pre-defined categories generated from a review of academic and policy literature. Findings - The results show that these definitions mostly appeal to actors working in roles with a strong input into the design process. The evidence suggests that all professional actors in the construction industry construct definitions of sustainable development to valorise their professional role, to support professional critiques of the industry or to reinforce their personal ideological beliefs. Research limitations/implications - These results present a challenge to a normative agenda aimed at ""pinning the concepts down"" to an unequivocal, universal definition. It suggests that research might be better redirected towards a context dependent and pragmatic use of the term. Practical implications - These findings suggest that future policy making should acknowledge multiple, sector and role-specific definitions of sustainable development. It also suggests that a better understanding of this diversity within the construction industry could improve the efficiency of the design, procurement and construction process. Originality/value - These findings provide new insight into the ""in use"" definitions of sustainable development in the construction industry and question some of the academic arguments that support a single, universal definition of the term.","POPULATIONS","Sustainability; Construction industry; Sustainable development; Building design; Sustainable construction; Policy concepts","SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT","Abrahams, G","[Abrahams, Gareth] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology","Science & Technology - Other Topics","Abrahams G., 2016, MAKING USE DELEUZE P##Abrahams G, 2014, EUR PLAN STUD, V22, P2134, DOI 10.1080/09654313.2013.819838##Agyeman J, 2003, ANN AM ACAD POLIT SS, V590, P35, DOI 10.1177/0002716203256565##Bazin D., 2004, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V7, P59##Christen M, 2012, SUSTAIN DEV, V20, P400, DOI 10.1002/sd.518##CIB, 1999, CIB REPORT PUBLICATI, V237##Cole RJ, 2005, BUILD RES INF, V33, P455, DOI 10.1080/09613210500219063##Creswell J.W., 2011, DESIGNING CONDUCTING, V2nd##Curtis S, 2000, SOC SCI MED, V50, P1001, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00350-0##Dobson A., 1996, ENVIRON POLIT, V5, P401, DOI DOI 10.1080/09644019608414280##EISENHARDT KM, 1989, ACAD MANAGE REV, V14, P532, DOI 10.2307/258557##Faludi A., 2002, MAKING EUROPEAN SPAT##Faulconbridge J, 2015, AREA, V47, P116, DOI 10.1111/area.12148##Giddings B, 2002, SUSTAIN DEV, V10, P187, DOI 10.1002/sd.199##GRIFFITHS P, 1993, ADDICTION, V88, P1617, DOI 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb02036.x##Groger L, 1999, QUAL HEALTH RES, V9, P829, DOI 10.1177/104973299129122180##Gunder M., 2009, PLANNING 10 WORDS LE##Haughton G, 1999, J PLAN EDUC RES, V18, P233, DOI 10.1177/0739456X9901800305##Hill R.

"J","WOS:000416704100013",2017,"The study on ecological sustainable development in Chengdu","Ecological footprint is one of the important methods to study ecological sustainable development, but ecological footprint focuses on only the static calculation of ecological sustainable development and cannot dynamically predict its development. In this study, we combine ecological footprint with system dynamics software STELLA to construct a predictable model of ecological sustainable development. We introduce rate1 and rate2 into the model, which reflects the change in per capita consumption of biological resources and energy due to the socio-economic development, and by changing the values of them to simulate a variety of scenarios. The results show that ecological sustainable development of Chengdu is in the state of ecological deficit, which is 1.43 million hm(2) in 2013, and different rate1 and rate2 will lead to different changes in the ecological deficit. When rate1 = rate2 = 0.1, the degree of ecological deficit in Chengdu is reduced from 1.43 million hm(2) to 1.24 million hm(2) in 2013-2018, and after 2018, it begins to increase, which will reach 1.32 million hm(2) in 2021. And when rate1 = rate2 = 0.05, the ecological deficit of Chengdu in 2013-2021 will decrease gradually, which from 1.43 million hm(2) to 1.31 million hm(2). These results reflect the impact of economic development on ecological sustainable development, and it can provide a reference for the balanced development of economic and ecological protection, which will help decision makers to do something for ecological sustainable development planning of Chengdu.

The aim is to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity, now and in the future. Sources of data: The UN has established web-sites to inform the implementation of the SDGs and an Inter-Agency and Expert Group on an Indicator Framework. We have searched for independent commentaries and analysis. Areas of agreement: The goals represent a framework that is scientifically robust, and widely intuitive intended to build upon the progress established by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There is a need for system wide strategic planning to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions into policy and actions. Areas of controversy: Many countries have yet to understand the difference between the MDGs and the SDGs, particularly their universality, the huge potential of new data methods to help with their implementation, and the systems thinking that is needed to deliver the vision. The danger is that individual goals may be prioritized without an understanding of the potential positive interactions between goals. Growing points: There is an increasing understanding that sustainable development needs a paradigm shift in our understanding of the interaction between the real economy and quality of life. There would be many social, environmental and economic benefits in changing our current model. Areas timely for developing research: We need to develop systems wide understanding of what supports a healthy environment and the art and science of making change.","HEALTH","sustainable development; global health; implementation; global goals","BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN","Morton, S##Pencheon, D##Squires, N","[Morton, Stephen] Publ Hlth England, Sustainabil & Publ Hlth Benefits, London, England.

This issue has been studied on the example of individual farms of south-eastern Poland, which benefited from programs to support sustainable agriculture in 2004-2013. The introduction of agriculture on the path of sustainable development depends on institutional factors (including political), which can induce farmers to take into account the environment and future generations in their microeconomic decisions. It has been shown that the most important barriers to the efficient and effective implementation of programs in support of sustainable agriculture are financial and information and education constraints.","PARTICIPATION","sustainable agriculture; sustainable development; farms; Common Agricultural Policy","SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT","Kata, R##Kusz, D","[Kata, Ryszard] Univ Rzeszow, Fac Econ, Ul Cwiklinskiej 2, PL-35601 Rzeszow, Poland.

"J","WOS:000423002500113",2018,"Promoting sustainable human development in engineering: Assessment of online courses within continuing professional development strategies","Higher Education Institutions play a critical role in societies transition towards sustainable development, educating future professionals and decision makers. In the last few decades, a number of technical universities have devoted major efforts to integrating sustainable development into engineering curricula. There is still, however, an increasing need to further transform learning and training environments and build capacity of educators and trainers on sustainable development issues. Against this background, this paper assesses the role of online training courses, within continuing professional development strategies, in promoting sustainable human development in engineering degrees. It was built upon the implementation of a European initiative, the Global Dimension in Engineering Education, promoted by a transdisciplinary consortium of technical universities and non-governmental organisations. In terms of method, this study analyses two sets of quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess i) the perceived quality/relevance of the training proposals, and ii) the learning acquisition of participants. Quantitative indicators were complemented by a descriptive analysis of findings from a semi-structured survey. The results provide evidence that online learning can be an effective approach for continuing professional development of academics. The findings also suggest that participants perceived online courses' contents and curricula, developed jointly by academics and practitioners of non-governmental organisations, as relevant and useful for integrating sustainability principles in teaching activities. To conclude, authors recommend the leaders of higher educational institutions to explore the integration of online courses addressed to faculty into university policy and strategies, as a way to promote professional development and the engagement of academics on sustainable development.

Originated from ecological and psychological sciences the term 'resilience' describes the capability to adapt and renew under unfavourable conditions while regional resilience is determined how the region or system responds to shock or disturbance and under these circumstances able to ensure its continuous development. Continuous development criterion links regional resilience to sustainable development (improve the lives of people round the World) promoted by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Developing criteria for resilient regions for promoting sustainable development could contribute to more complex comprehension of regions in spatial development.

It offers a good opportunity to reinvigorate sustainable development research for two main reasons. First, it comprises many areas of SD research, which have become mainstream thanks to the UN SDGs. Second, the fact that the UN and its member countries have committed to attaining SDGs by 2030 has added a sense of urgency to the need to perform quality research on SD on the one hand, and reiterates the need to use the results of this research on the other. Even though the basic concept of sustainability goes back many centuries, it has only recently appeared on the international political agenda. This is partly due to an awakening of the fact that the human ecological pressure on the planet is still much larger than what nature can renew or compensate for. Based on this state of affairs, this paper presents an outline of the process leading to the agreement on the UN SDGs, and looks at some of the ecological aspects as a result of continued pressure of human activities on natural resources. Furthermore, a set of research needs is proposed - also based holistically on updated research trends - discussing the degree of urgency of some measures and explaining why the UN SDGs need to be accorded greater priority in international sustainable development research efforts.","DEGROWTH; SCIENCE; CLIMATE; FUTURE; HEALTH","Sustainable development goals; implementation; UN 2030 Agenda; research; international sustainable development","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Leal, W##Azeiteiro, U##Alves, F##Pace, P##Mifsud, M##Brandli, L##Caeiro, SS##Disterheft, A","[Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England.

In doing so, it is envisaged that United Nations' expectations from member states regarding their national security policies and organizations could be revealed. Security thinking has changed since late 1980's with the introduction of sustainable development approach by the United Nations. This shift in security thinking encompasses human security and security-development nexus. Holding all member states responsible, Millennium Declaration and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development constitute the primary and the most recent outcome documents of United Nations' sustainable development policy. Both documents have security components. This enables extracting security elements and comparing them with an analytical manner. Consequently, findings are compared and discussed in terms of public policy and organization at national level.","POLICY TRANSFER","Security; Sustainable Development; Public Policy; United Nations","JOURNAL OF MEHMET AKIF ERSOY UNIVERSITY ECONOMICS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES FACULTY","Barbak, A","[Barbak, Ahmet] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, IIBF, Kamu Yonetimi Bolumu, Izmir, Turkey.","Economics","Business & Economics","BRIASSOULIS H., 2005, POLICY INTEGRATION C, P81##CHRISTIENSEN T., 2006, 6 S ROKK CTR SOC STU##Dolowitz DP, 2000, GOVERNANCE, V13, P5, DOI 10.1111/0952-1895.00121##Drezner D, 2001, INT STUDIES REV, V3, P53, DOI DOI 10.1111/1521-9488.00225##Duffield M, 2010, SECUR DIALOGUE, V41, P53, DOI 10.1177/0967010609357042##Evans M, 1999, PUBLIC ADMIN, V77, P361, DOI 10.1111/1467-9299.00158##Hrychuk H, 2009, INT J-TORONTO, V64, P825, DOI 10.1177/002070200906400314##INTERNATIONAL PEACE ACADEMY, 2004, NEW YORK SEM 2004 37##JACKSON P, 2015, HDB INT SECURITY DEV, P1, DOI DOI 10.4337/9781781955536.00006##Knill C, 2005, J EUR PUBLIC POLICY, V12, P764, DOI 10.1080/13501760500161332##Krahmann E, 2008, EUR J INT RELAT, V14, P379, DOI 10.1177/1354066108092304##MARCH JG, 1984, AM POLIT SCI REV, V78, P734, DOI 10.2307/1961840##Meijers E, 2004, 2004 BERL C HUM DIM##NIKOLAISEN T., 2011, SECURITY SECTOR REFO##Noya A., 2008, IMPROVING SOCIAL INC##Paris R, 2001, INT SECURITY, V26, P87, DOI 10.1162/016228801753191141##Schnabel Albrecht, 2012, BACK ROOTS SECURITY, P29##Stern M, 2010, SECUR DIALOGUE, V41, P5, DOI 10.1177/0967010609357041##Stone D, 2004, J EUR PUBLIC POLICY, V11, P545, DOI 10.1080/13501760410001694291##UN, 2010, AN MEAS SOC INCL GLO##UN, 2015, TRANSFORMING OUR WOR##*UNDP, 1994, HUM DEV REP 1994##United Nations, 1987, REPORT WORLD COMMISS##Waldman Anne, 1991, NEW I ORG ANAL, P1, DOI DOI 10.1075/TSL.19.1.02CLO##World Bank, 2011, WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2011: CONFLICT, SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT, P1, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8439-8##ZAEI M.

Despite the fact that migration and human mobility issues are mentioned only in six goals, they actually affect the achievement of majority of them. The impact of forced mass internal migration in Ukraine on its sustainable development goals achievement is shown as complex, manysided, unpredictable and different in strength. Forced displacement of people seem to have not only negative, but also positive impact on country's sustainable development. Moreover, the achievement of goals in its turn influenced further migration in Ukraine. Perception of forced migration as temporary influence the behaviour of internally displaced people and thus the level and possibility of achievement of sustainable development goals in the country. The analysis of the impact of migration on sustainable development allows to determine priorities and instruments for fight with negative phenomena and support the positive impact of forced migration on the development of regions in Ukraine.",NA,"sustainable development; sustainable development goals; migration; internally displaced person; achievement; forced displacement; impact","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Semenenko, I##Khandii, O","[Semenenko, Inna; Khandii, Olena] Volodymyr Dahl East Ukrainian Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Entrepreneurship, Pr Tsentralny 59-A, UA-93400 Severodonetsk, Ukraine.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","[Anonymous], MIGRATION SUSTAINABI##[Anonymous], 2016, ZVIT PROSTAN VYKONAN##[Anonymous], 2016, LUHANSHCHYNI UPROVAD##[Anonymous], 10 RECHEI YAKI POTRI##[Anonymous], 2016, ES NADAV 10 MLN YEVR##[Anonymous], 2016, STAVLENNIA NASELENNI##[Anonymous], 2015, TRANSFORMING OUR WOR##[Anonymous], 2015, REHIONALNA PROHRAMA##[Anonymous], SPOZH PROD KHARCH DO##[Anonymous], 2014, SCH VYK ROZP KAB MIN##[Anonymous], 2015, GENDER DIMENSIONS SM##[Anonymous], 2015, TEMATYCHNYI ZVIT ZAK##[Anonymous], 2015, TSILI ROZVYTKU TYSIA##[Anonymous], GENDERNA RIVNIST##[Anonymous], 2015, KHOCHU VSTUPYTY VNZ##[Anonymous], 2015, TEMATYCHNYI ZVIT DOS##[Anonymous], 2015, SUSTAINABLE DEV GOAL##[Anonymous], INFORM PRONADANNIA P##[Anonymous], 2015, KILK PIDPR LUH OBL I##[Anonymous], 2016, STRATEHIIA ROZVYTKU##[Anonymous], 2016, ZAR HROM ORH PIVR 20##[Anonymous], 2016, TEMATYCHNYI ZVIT VNU##[Anonymous], 2016, OBL 1 656 662 PER MI##[Anonymous], DYF ZHYTT RIVN NAS##[Anonymous], IZ ZONY ATO KRYMU PE##GOVERNMENT AGENCY Institute of Economics and Forecasting of NAS Ukraine, 2016, INF AN MAT PARL SLUK##KULYTSKYI S., 2016, UKRAINE EVENTS FACTS, V18, P47##MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE of Ukraine, SPYS PROEKT##NOVIKOVA O.

There is an argument that, Buddha places emphasis upon a logical understanding of the cause of human suffering. He explains ignorance as the root link in the causal chain and, thus, shows the way towards Nirvana. Human suffering is not due to the devaluation of nature. It is due to the pain that is associated with the cycle of birth and rebirth. Hence, Buddhist philosophy is dysteleological in its nature. That's why it is hard to discuss sustainable development within the framework of Buddhist philosophy. In this paper, I have argued that Buddhist philosophy places a substantial emphasis upon sentient as well as non-sentient beings.

This paper describes a ""sustainable development as process"" (SDAP) approach for the forest sector and the principles involved in such an approach. These principles relate to how the forest sector processes need to evolve to meet the ever-changing global challenges facing the sector in the context of the new UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is argued that there is need for much stronger, effective linkages between processes within the sector and with other sectors locally and across countries.

"J","WOS:000427831200004",1994,"Pollution prevention for sustainable development: the land-use question","The central argument of the paper is that effective pollution prevention can be achieved only by integrated land-use planning which offers the broad framework for co-ordinating technological and non-technological means to achieve sustainable development. The paper first reviews the role of land-use in preventing or contributing to pollution over time, focusing especially on contemporary efforts to promote environmental protection through land-use planning and management. The relationship between land-use, pollution and sustainable development is analysed by examining the most important types of land-use-related problems, discussing their causes and identifying a number of land-use-related constraints to sustainable development. Finally, a land-use planning and policy framework approach to pollution prevention for sustainable development is outlined which emphasizes the need for integrated analysis of pollution problems and adoption of comprehensive approaches to their solution. Scientific, spatial, temporal and policy issues are addressed in the context of the proposed approach.",NA,"pollution prevention; sustainable development; land-use planning","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Briassoulis, H","[Briassoulis, H.] Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos, Athens, Greece.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Adams C.

"J","WOS:000428117000002",2018,"Ramping Up Resistance: Corporate Sustainable Development and Academic Research","We argue the need for academics to resist and challenge the hegemonic discourse of sustainable development within the corporate context. Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory provides a useful framework for recognizing the complex nature of sustainable development and a way of conceptualizing counter-hegemonies. Published empirical research that analyzes sustainable development discourse within corporate reports is examined to consider how the hegemonic discourse is constructed. Embedded assumptions within the hegemonic construction are identified including sustainable development as primarily about economic development, progress, growth, profitability, and ""responsibly"" managed levels of resource depletion. We call for multiple voices in the discursive field to debate and to resist closure and highlight the possibilities for academic researchers to actively resist the hegemonic construction. Specifically, we advocate vigilance and awareness, critical and reflective analyses, challenge and resistance based on other frames of reference, and strategies for communicating both within and outside the academy.","MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; POLITICS; ACCOUNTS; ACCOUNTABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; DISCOURSE; ACTIVISM; ECOLOGY","sustainable development; reporting; discourse theory; resistance; academic research","BUSINESS & SOCIETY","Tregidga, H##Milne, MJ##Kearins, K","[Tregidga, Helen] Auckland Univ Technol, Accounting, Auckland, New Zealand.

"J","WOS:000428582400001",2018,"Scales of integration for sustainable development governance","Efforts at integration are central in the Sustainable Development Goals and the wider Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda. While integration forms a major focus of this agenda, there are fundamental limitations on pursuing this focus. The global governance discussions on integration lack a clear conceptualization of what it is, do not have any tools for measurement or assessment, and are narrowly focused around policy integration between global institutions. This article develops a framework for conceptualizing cross-level and cross-scale integration which addresses these problems and introduces the opportunities and challenges of pursuing different types of integration in global governance. Cross-level integration involves governance efforts which seek to bridge similar institutions with one another (for example, bringing together efforts by environmental ministries and development ministries). Cross-scale integration, in contrast, deals with governance efforts that bring together institutions which have distinct scopes, jurisdictions, and epistemologies. With this important distinction, the article explores the opportunities for cross-scale integration as part of the global sustainable development efforts and particularly expanding the policy integration focus with spatial and temporal integration as well. The conclusion uses the Earth System Governance perspective to focus on the trade-offs that are likely as wider forms of institutional integration are pursued beyond environmental mainstreaming and policy integration.","DEVELOPMENT GOALS; GLOBAL CHANGE; COMANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; AMERICAN; SCIENCE","Integration; Sustainable Development Goals; global governance policy integration; cross-scale","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Stevens, C","[Stevens, Casey] Clark Univ, Polit Sci, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Abbott K.

In order for the SDG targets to be obtainable, diverse stakeholders need the technical, institutional, and organizational capacity to implement the wide variety of initiatives covered under these goals. Inspired by a 2016 workshop, this article synthesizes capacity-building themes and strategies for the following approaches to sustainable development, specifically related to forestry, restoration, agriculture, and other forms of land management. Using three case studies from the authors' experience, we present approaches to building local capacity for sustainable land management (SLM) in the tropics. These projects have taken different steps in order to build technical and leadership capacity as well as develop management or financial skills, and offer insight into various approaches that may be used in order to improve the effectiveness and long-term impact of SLM efforts. By presenting a range of tools and approaches to capacity building, the authors hope that this synthesis can serve as a valuable guide for the development of diverse capacity-building initiatives required to meet the SDGs.","ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; MEXICO","Capacity building; capacity development; forest management; sustainable development; sustainable land management; training; tropical conservation; tropical restoration; United Nations sustainable development goals","JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY","Bloomfield, G##Bucht, K##Martinez-Hernandez, JC##Ramirez-Soto, AF##Shesena-Hernandez, I##Lucio-Palacio, CR##Inzunza, ER","[Bloomfield, Gillian; Bucht, Karin] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Environm Leadership & Training Initiat, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.

A Systematic Literature Review","The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations recognize and promote interand intra-dependencies between the economic, social and ecological dimensions, emphasize the inclusion of local communities in the development processes and the need for sustainable consumption and production. To achieve these goals, interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts are needed. Frugal innovation emerges as a paradigm challenging traditional innovation pathways which may have the potential to bring together different stakeholders' efforts to achieve sustainable development goals. This systematic literature review analyzes current research linking the concepts of frugal innovation and sustainable development. The aim is to highlight approaches and conditions in which frugal innovations can drive sustainable development, especially in relation to different types of private sector actors. Based on the content analysis of current studies, we formulate shortcomings of existing research and develop a research agenda with the aim to bring the two research streams closer.","BUSINESS MODEL; EMERGING MARKETS; INCLUSIVE GROWTH; INDIA; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; GOVERNANCE; POVERTY; BOTTOM; TECHNOLOGIES; BANGLADESH","frugal innovation; sustainability; inclusive development; Base of the Pyramid; sustainable development","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH","Rosca, E##Reedy, J##Bendul, JC","[Rosca, Eugenia; Reedy, Jack; Bendul, Julia C.] Jacobs Univ Bremen gGmbH, Sch Math & Logist, Coll Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.","Development Studies","Development Studies","Alcott B, 2008, ECOL ECON, V64, P770, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.04.015##Altmann P, 2016, RES TECHNOL MANAGE, V59, P48, DOI 10.1080/08956308.2016.1117323##[Anonymous], 2015, MILL DEV GOALS REP##Arnold M., 2016, J CLEANER P IN PRESS##Banejee AV, 2007, J ECON PERSPECT, V21, P141, DOI 10.1257/jep.21.1.141##Bansal P, 2003, ORGAN SCI, V14, P510, DOI 10.1287/orsc.14.5.510.16765##Basu R.

"J","WOS:000430648000005",2018,"The effects of dynamic industrial transition on sustainable development","This paper analyzes the dynamics of industrial development and structural changes, and its impacts on sustainable development. The weak form of the Porter Hypothesis is examined under industrial transition and structural changes. Explicitly incorporating the Markov regime switching mechanism in a productivity framework, we measure how sustainable development is affected and how firms are adjusted when facing industrial transition and structural changes. Applied to Taiwan manufacturing industries, the model is implemented to identify structural changes and to evaluate the viability of sustainable development under new constraints. This study suggests industries to adopt more sustainable practices which can promote and even improve industrial competitiveness. Such practices would empower economies to assess current structural changes and, based on the environmental implications, recommend future economic policy for sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000430779600029",2018,"Academics in the field of Education for Sustainable Development: Their conceptions of sustainable development","Recent policy and academic voices in the field of Education for Sustainable Development put forward the importance of a holistic approach to the concept of Sustainable Development. We investigated the personal understanding of 'Sustainable Development' of scholars involved in teacher training programs and in the academic field of Education for Sustainable Development. To this purpose, an on-line survey was conducted based on the principle of comparative judgement. After careful selection, 249 academics were found to fit the specific profile for inclusion into the study. All of them were invited and56 of them participated. The instrument consisted of 16 statements built specifically to reflect different interpretations of sustainable development: fragmented, separated, holistic and integrated perspectives. Each participant compared 12 pairs of statements and were asked to decide which one better represented their interpretation of the concept of Sustainable Development in the context of Education for Sustainable Development. Using the D-PAC methodology for comparative judgement, our results show that the statements that were most often chosen prioritized an understanding of Sustainable Development according to which two or three of the dimensions of the concept (environment, society, economy) are seen as separated to each other and less often in an integrated way. The scale reliability was equal to 0.79, indicating good quality of the measurement. The results show that academics in the field of Education for Sustainable Development do not conceive of the concept of Sustainable Development holistically. There is also a tendency towards social and economic aspects of Sustainable Development. Implications for Education for Sustainable Development research and teacher training are discussed.

This paper argues that actually implementing the SDGs is far more challenging than reaching agreement to adopt them. To overcome these challenges, a Four-Step Adaptive Governance Framework was set up to facilitate implementation of these goals. Two-level policy tools are presented to illustrate the policy evolution of China's development transitions, within the framework of adaptive governance. This study found that the Four-Step Adaptive Governance Approach is deeply embedded in China's policy process, and it has contributed significantly to China's development during the past four decades. The Adaptive Governance Framework and this example of its application in China suggests it could be a useful tool for developing countries that are formulating their national strategies to achieve their SDGs by 2030.","COMMONS","adaptive governance approach; challenges; China; Sustainable Development Goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Xue, L##Weng, LF##Yu, HZ","[Xue, Lan; Weng, Lingfei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000431157100019",2018,"Think globally, act locally: Implementing the sustainable development goals in Montenegro","Following the UN adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, the Government of Montenegro entered in the final phase of revising of National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD 2030). Under the supervision of the National Council for Sustainable Development, Climate Change and Integrated Coastal Zone Management, an NSSD team of national and international experts was assembled under the coordination of the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism. To demonstrate commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda, Montenegro decided to center the NSSD 2030 on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), targets and indicators. One of the first UN member countries to implement the UN 2030 Agenda within the national policy context, Montenegro adopted its NSSD 2030 on July 7, 2016. As members of the NSSD team, here we 1) describe how the UN 2030 Agenda has been implemented within the policy context of Montenegro's NSSD 2030, and 2) focus on the identification of the NSSD 2030 monitoring and reporting framework. Our key finding is that 26 institutions will be handling data for assessing 137 out of the 241 (56.8%) SDG indicators in the first reporting period scheduled for 2019. Although the paper deals with the implementation of the SDGs in Montenegro and its implications, we believe it will be useful in informing other countries in their process of national transposition and operationalization of the UN 2030 Agenda.","INDICATORS; CHALLENGES; GOVERNANCE","SDGs; Indicators; Sustainable development strategy; Monitoring & Reporting; Montenegro","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY","Galli, A##Durovic, G##Hanscom, L##Knezevic, J","[Galli, Alessandro] Global Footprint Network, 18 Ave Louis Casai, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland.

They cover technical innovations and responsible consumption of environmental resources, along with global efforts to ensure that progress does not impede future generations from achieving a desirable improvement of social and economic conditions based on this momentum. This article aims to place ecological practices in the context of a sustainable development agenda and discusses the conceptual meaning of the term ecological practices. It also examines the determinants of ecological practices in developing countries, including Nigeria. The text developed the Generational Development Framework (GDF) to analyze the connection between green practices and sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000431937500021",2018,"Key characteristics of academics promoting Sustainable Human Development within engineering studies","In the last decade, a growing number of technical universities and engineering faculties have been promoting various initiatives aimed at integrating sustainable development in their activities. Despite the fact that the commitment of the academic staff has been widely recognised to have a key role in university change processes towards sustainable development, few studies have specifically analysed the characteristics of academics engaged in such processes. The present study provides an analysis and a profile of a group of academics, participating in a training programme on sustainable human development, granted by a European fund. The methods employed include a semi-structured survey, focusing on the academic activities and social outreach of the participants, complemented by a bibliometric analysis of their scientific production. The findings show: 1) an interdisciplinary profile of the academics, 2) an integration of sustainable development principles in all academic activities and 3) a promotion of those principles outside the university. It is emphasised that the commitment of this type of academics can facilitate a cultural change in engineering education, as well as more holistic transformations of universities towards sustainable development. The paper concludes by providing recommendations for leaders and policy makers of higher education institutions on the implementation of appropriate policies and mechanisms to facilitate faculty engagement in sustainable development.

"J","WOS:000432337100004",2018,"Approach to Groundwater Management towards Sustainable Development in India","The management of groundwater resources for sustainable development is a challenging task in India because of its vast geographical extent (3287000 km(2)), where about 1250 million people live. As a result, the Country is facing scarcity of drinking water quite often. This situation compels to adopt management practices for the development of sustainable groundwater resources. The objective of the paper is to focus on need of adoption of appropriate management strategies for sustainable development of groundwater resources. In view of this the groundwater situation in India as reflected through published literature has been discussed, in which the causes of scarcity, aquifer situation, and groundwater assessment in India have been explained. Based on this study the future approach for groundwater management to achieve the objective of sustainable development has been suggested. This paper provides insight to all the controlling factors affecting groundwater resources in India. Based on this, suggestions for future implementation of water conservation programmes have also been discussed. The present study shows that despite availability of ample groundwater resources the country faces drinking water scarcity quite often. This fact needs further analysis of scarcity situation to provide everlasting solution of problems related to groundwater.","ARTIFICIAL-RECHARGE; IDENTIFICATION; URBANIZATION; AREAS; GIS; BASIN; WATER","Sustainable development; groundwater management; controlling factors; India","ACQUE SOTTERRANEE-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER","Khare, YD##Varade, AM","[Varade, A.

However, this concept has been based since its origins primarily on its environmental and economic position, to the detriment of its social dimension. The question that thus arises Is the social perspective and specifically the environmental justice and equity of sustainability the most overlooked? This article will explain the reasons why the social dimension, is considered crucial to the concept of sustainable development. When this social dimension has been considered, very promising concepts have been relevant to this debate: environmental justice, environmental space, ecological footprint and ecological debt, all contributing to the deepening of the paradigm of Just Sustainability.","ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE; INDICATORS; INEQUALITY; POLLUTION; ENGLAND; INCOME","Sustainable development; social sustainability; environmental justice; equity; sustainable development goals; just sustainability","REVISTA ESPANOLA DE SOCIOLOGIA","Lopez, I##Arriaga, A##Pardo, M","[Lopez, Ivan] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Trabajo, Despacho 57,C Violante Hungria 23, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.

"J","WOS:000432771000074",2018,"Intersection of economic and environmental goals of sustainable development initiatives","There is growing interest in integration of sustainability into business planning decisions under a sustainable development framework. Environmental accounting methodologies for collection, measurement, and disclosure of financial and environmental impacts of strategic and operational managerial decisions are developed and utilized by business entities worldwide for effective management of both organizational and operational environmental protection policies. At the operational level, while extant literature has primarily focused on managerial decision making under different voluntary and regulatory emission pricing schemes, the intersection of economic (monetary) and environmental impact (nonmonetary/physical) dimensions of sustainable development goals has received scant attention. This paper examines the intersection of the environmental and economic goals of sustainable development initiatives of a focal firm, which is engaged in the primary activities of production and/or transportation and storage of a single product within a forward supply chain. This paper assumes the presence of a responsive ""green market "" through modeling of consumer awareness and response induced by the firms' environmental footprint disclosures. Through quantitative modeling approach, normative conclusions are derived on the compatibility of economic and environmental goals of sustainable development initiative. The results indicate the presence of convergence, divergence, and avoidance decision zones in balancing the environmental and economical goals of the firm's sustainable development for production and storage efficiency. The paper explicitly establishes the boundaries of the operational zones within the domain of the firm's environmental reduction and operational efficiency efforts. The results demonstrate that the efficacy of voluntary or regulated emission reduction targets depends on the firm's existing environmental and operational cost structures, and hence emission reduction targets must be well planned to avoid adverse environmental impact or operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that in a green responsive market, there may exist critical emission reduction thresholds below which the economic and environmental benefits of sustainable development initiatives diverge.

This situation is directly related to the problem of the relationship between culture and science. We have proven that the ""metaphysical perception"" of sustainable development is defined by the culture of international organizations. We affirm that research knowledge of the process of sustainable development is not formed due to the lack of a scientific subject. The current relationship between philosophy and scientific methodology allows us to choose the ""ontology"" and ""method"" for forming sustainable development science. We believe that the task of transferring the practical phenomena classified as ""sustainable development"" into the classical forms of scientific knowledge will happen in the near future. We reconstructed the philosophical concept of ""ontology"" and studied it as the methodological creation tool of sustainable development science. Choosing a name for sustainable development science attracts the resources of both semantics and semiotics. We wanted to differentiate the objects of ecology and sustainable development science and used the means of the systematic approach. Philosophy has provided our research with the method of ""reflective analysis"". We clarified its modern function in science. Reflective analysis solves the problem of the creation of ""transformed"" scientific forms (models and knowledge) on the material of heterogeneous practices of sustainable development. In this article we present the first systematic definition of the object of sustainable development science.

"J","WOS:000433731000010",2016,"SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY OF BUSINESS","Today sustainable development is a widely used term, which has been increasingly influential in recent years. Debates about sustainability no longer consider sustainability solely as an environmental concern, but also incorporate economic and social dimensions. However, while a social and economic dimensions of sustainable development are widely discussed, environmental degradation becomes more and more crucial each year and is likely to reduce human well-being all across the world within the next few decades. The purpose of the paper is to analyse ecological 'pillar' of sustainable development, its historical background, main steps towards implementation of 'new global environmental rules for society. Methodology. The paper is based on statistical information from public sources, reports of different international organizations and institutions, which are used to stress and underline main crucial points of research. Results of the survey show, that environmental quality, economic development and social well-being are interdependent and the main aim of international institutions, independent countries, businesses and society is to achieve environmentally sustainable development. Environmental issues make strong impact on modern economy. Responsible global strategy of development provides the whole society with rules, how 'wise' technological changes and economic policy can make industrial production processes less polluting and less resource intensive but yet more productive and profitable. Practical implications. Strategy of sustainable development and it's three basic dimensions have found practical implication in one complex model, which illustrates the level of development of each country - the Human Development Index, which is focusing on three basic dimensions of human development: life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling and gross national income per capita. Another data, which is used on the basis of sustainable development indicator's' is Environmental Performance Index - method of quantifying and numerically marking the environmental performance of a state's policies, which was designed to supplement the environmental targets set forth in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. All these indicators and indexes should be a platform for modern successful socio-economic development of Ukraine. Value/originality. The theme of sustainable development has long history and levels of development, but yet it is very popular and important for each country and the world as a whole. Many issues of this strategy of development depend not only from governments, but from the engines of economic growth - companies. Today the aim for businesses is to create higher standards of living and quality of life, proper ecological situation in the communities in which they operate, while still preserving profitability for stakeholders.",NA,"sustainable development; ecological responsibility; business social responsibility; indicators of sustainable development; Human Development Index; Environmental Performance Index","BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES","Krykun, V","[Krykun, Viktoria] Taros Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Inst Int Relat, Dept Int Business, Kiev, Ukraine.","Economics","Business & Economics","[Anonymous], 2016, ENV PERF IND REP##Basiago A.D., 1998, ENVIRONMENTALIST, V19, P145, DOI [DOI 10.1023/A:1006697118620, 10.1023/a:1006697118620]##Harvey F., 2015, GUARDIAN##Hopwood B, 2005, SUSTAIN DEV, V13, P38, DOI 10.1002/sd.244##Kahn M, 1995, P 1995 INT SUST DEV, P2##Keating M., 1993, EARTH SUMMITS AGENDA, V12-13, P63##Kothari R., 1990, ETHICS ENV DEV, P27##Lee K., 2000, GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE D, P31##McGuire Joseph William, 1963, BUSINESS SOC##REDCLIFT M, 1993, ENVIRON VALUE, V2, P3, DOI 10.3197/096327193776679981##The Brundtland Commission, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##UN, 1998, KYOT PROT UN FRAM CO##United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 1992, AG 21##United Nations Development Programme, 2015, 2030 AG SUST DEV##United Nations Development Programme, 2015, HUMAN DEV REPORT##Vasseur E., 1973, UN C HUM ENV, V7, P1227##World Business Council for Sustainable Development, 1998, TRAD ENV SUST DEV BR",1,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM12","no","SDG.12#SDG.8#SDG.9"

The basic goal is to educate local communities in the principles of this new approach. The purpose of the study was to diagnose programs produced by local governments in the area of sustainable tourism development, identify problem areas, and propose solutions. The study was based on surveys in paper form. Most local governments in Poland (62%) state that sustainable development is considered in their planning and implementation of tourism-related programs. More than three out of four local government officials state that the opinions of local residents are also considered in the process. At the same time, more than 60% of survey participants state that their local municipality does not facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences in the area of sustainable development via the organization of relevant conferences, meetings, and workshops. In addition, local government officials note the existence of conflicts associated with collaboration in the tourism sector, mostly manifested by differences of opinion in terms of environmental protection versus tourism development. However, research has shown that the number of conflicts is smaller when the quality (i.e. higher mark) of the collaboration is higher.","CONFLICT","Sustainable development; Tourism; Local government; Municipality; Poland","SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY","Kapera, I","[Kapera, Izabela] Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Krakow Univ, Fac Law Adm & Int Relat, Gustawa Herlinga Grudzinskiego 1, PL-30705 Krakow, Poland.","Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels","Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels","Abu Al Haija A, 2011, HABITAT INT, V35, P93, DOI 10.1016/j.habitatint.2010.04.002##Agyeiwaah E, 2017, TOUR MANAG PERSPECT, V24, P26, DOI 10.1016/j.tmp.2017.07.005##Dominguez-Gomez JA, 2017, TOURISM MANAGE, V63, P135, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2017.05.015##Borlido T, 2016, DOS ALGARVES A MULTI, V28, P29, DOI DOI 10.18089/DAMEJ.2016.28.3##Butler R.

Although sustainable development is a widely accepted paradigm and enshrined in legislation from global to local levels, implementation continues to be a challenge. It has been argued that the term is an oxymoron and also that sustainable tourism is an excessively narrow concept for sustainability is at root a multi-sectoral concept. What is to be sustained is not self-evident and can be debated. As a minimum, it is necessary to develop indicators and this can be done through top-down or bottom-up procedures or a combination of both. In fact, the development of indicators has become a 'growth industry'. In an attempt to further broaden an already broad discussion and drawing upon the author's experiences primarily in Indonesia and Taiwan, as well as recent literature on resilience, the important role of culture will be emphasised and the potential utility of the notion of resilience will be discussed. Finally, a modified sustainable livelihoods framework that incorporates these ideas is presented as a possible way forward.","TOURISM; RESILIENCE; SIMILARITIES; MANAGEMENT","Sustainable development; culture; resilience; sustainable livelihood; Indonesia; Taiwan","TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH","Wall, G","[Wall, Geoffrey] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.","Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism","Social Sciences - Other Topics","Burton I., 1965, READINGS RESOURCE MA##Butler R.W., 2018, TOURISM RESILIENCE##Chambers R., 1992, 296 IDS##Cheer J., 2018, TOURISM RESILIENCE S##Espiner S, 2017, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V25, P1385, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2017.1281929##Hall C.

"J","WOS:000436570100342",2018,"Designing Learning for Sustainable Development: Digital Practices as Boundary Crossers and Predictors of Sustainable Lifestyles","Sustainable development (SD) is a multidimensional issue. However, research findings report a divide between students' awareness and behavior. It is identified that study programs are designed more for awareness outcomes, and not so much for behavioral outcomes. For higher-order learning outcomes manifested in a sustainable development behavior, the authors argue for a model based on an understanding of learning as boundary crossing. Based on this model, learning for sustainable development occurs in relating social practices, lifestyles, academic practices, professional practices, and students' digital practices. To inform teachers' approaches to teaching as an important driver of institutional change, we conducted a survey among students of urban and spatial planning in Slovenia. Examined factors included personal, academic, and digital predictors for sustainable development awareness, lifestyle, and behavioral intention. We hypothesized that a significant predictor for sustainable development behavior, which was measured as sustainable lifestyle and sustainable development behavioral intention, would be learning in social practices, and that learning in social practices would predict preferred teaching methods. The findings of hierarchical regression analysis indicated personal factors as the most important predictors of SD behavioral intention, and academic predictors as the most important factors for SD awareness. Digital practices were found to be the most important predictors of a sustainable lifestyle. Social practices of sustainable lifestyle, digital practices, and perceived teaching methods predicted students' preferred teaching methods. We discuss the future directions of sustainable development education, considering digital social media practices as essential boundary crossers.","HIGHER-EDUCATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; STUDENTS; COMPETENCES; METAANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; SEEKING","sustainable development education; behavioral change; sustainable lifestyle; informal and formal learning; online social media","SUSTAINABILITY","Starcic, AI##Terlevic, M##Lin, L##Lebenicnik, M","[Starcic, Andreja Istenic] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.

To date, the CDM has failed to achieve these goals. This article argues that the CDM's shortcomings are due to path dependence, with the CDM stuck at a suboptimal equilibrium of insufficient institutions, capital and leadership. A reform scheme involving foreign direct investment, foreign aid and CDM amendments is prescribed for pushing the CDM to a more efficient and prosperous path. A properly functioning CDM would afford both developed and developing countries the opportunity to secure a more sustainable economic and environmental future.",NA,"clean development mechanism; path dependence; law and development; institutions and development; sustainable development","LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW","Condon, A","[Condon, Alexander] Univ Toronto, Fac Law, Toronto, ON 2015, Canada.","Law","Government & Law","Bandyopadhyay S, 2013, FED RESERVE BANK ST, V95, P327##Blanco G, 2014, CLIMATE CHANGE 2014: MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE, P351##Brooks N, 2009, DEV POLICY REV, V27, P741, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-7679.2009.00468.x##Brunt C., 2005, DELIVERING SUSTAINAB##Busse M, 2010, REV WORLD ECON, V146, P147, DOI 10.1007/s10290-009-0046-x##Castro Paula, 2010, CLIMATE CHANGE MITIG, P8##CDM Policy Dialogue, 2012, CLIM CHANG CARB MARK, P50##Cigaran Maria Paz, 2004, I STRATEGY PROMOTE C, P45##Civelli Andrea, 2014, THEORETICAL MODEL EM, P29##Demery Lionel, 1987, ALLEVIATION POVERTY, P18##Desai Vandana, 2008, COMPANION DEV STUDIE, P87##Filmer D, 2014, AFR DEV FORUM, P1, DOI 10.1596/978-1-4648-0107-5##Gilau AM, 2007, ENERG POLICY, V35, P5526, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2007.05.031##Gupta J, 2009, CURR OPIN ENV SUST, V1, P207, DOI 10.1016/j.cosust.2009.10.004##Halsnaes Kirsten, 2008, MITIGATION ADAPTATIO, V13, P113##Harvey D, 2005, BRIEF HIST NEOLIBERL##He JJ, 2014, GREENH GASES, V4, P750, DOI 10.1002/ghg.1448##Huang YF, 2012, ENERG ECON, V34, P1033, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2011.08.010##International Monetary Fund, 2012, WORLD EC OUTLOOK OCT##Juhnke Chris, 2012, ENVIRON POLICY LAW, V42, P152##Kenny Charles, 2012, GETTING BETTER WHY G, P190##Kharas Homi, 2010, EMERGING MIDDLE CLAS, P12##Kirkman Grant A., 2012, UN FRAM CONV CLIM CH, P10##Lachapelle Erick, 2010, REV POLICY RES, V29, P349##Lehavi A, 2011, YALE J INT L, V36, P115##Lloyd B, 2010, ENERG POLICY, V38, P7378, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.08.014##Lucon O, 2014, CLIMATE CHANGE 2014: MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE, P671##MARTINOT E, 2002, GRID BASED RENEWABLE##Michaelowa Axel, 2007, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V84, P16##Moyo Dambisa, 2009, HUFFINGTON POST##Naucler T., 2009, PATHWAYS LOW CARBON, P192##North D.

This study is based on a comprehensive review of the literature and UN program documents in the area of sustainable development. Quantitative data were gathered through questionnaires, measuring perceived values, objectives and challenges relating to sustainable development from various categories of respondents. The final results are discussed in light of this background knowledge. We have learned that there is a difference in the understanding of key values, objectives and problems relating to sustainable development in Russia among various respondents. The findings illustrate that education in the area of sustainable development could serve to reduce current gaps.

Talks with the key note speaker and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cleaner Production led to an idea to develop a special volume about innovative products and services according to the themes of the conference. Thus, the purpose of this special volume is to explore different viewpoints of how innovative products and services may support sustainable societal development. There are five thematic areas with papers that describe new advancements in different industries and organizations. The included papers cover relevant theoretical background and present case studies and practical results. This special volume shows that great progresses are being made in different thematic areas but also that there are so much more waiting to be done for sustainable societal development. This volume indicates that cross-disciplinary approach is truly needed to achieve societal sustainable development. This requires people to change their mindsets and genuinely co-operate towards better future.

"J","WOS:000441723100022",2018,"ENERGY SOURCES ANALYSIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","A judicious use of energy is a fundamental factor to achieve sustainable development. The limited character of energetic fossil resources and the pollution generated by burning fossil fuels for electricity production generate the need to replace them with other sources of energy. Despite the fact that fossil fuels would continue to play a prevailing role in the energy supply for decades to come, renewable energy resources have the potential of contributing to the increasing global energy demands, while simultaneously emerge the most efficient solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in the world. In this framework, the main scope of the present study is to provide an analysis of the current state of world natural resources used to produce energy and energy consumption degree across different regions of the world. At the same time, this paper aims to compare the environmental impacts in water, air, soil and ecosystem produced by a range of conventional and renewable energy sources, which is necessary to be reduced for building a genuine low-carbon society.","ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; RENEWABLE ENERGY; NUCLEAR-POWER; TECHNOLOGIES; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK; BIOFUELS; PEOPLE; CRETE","energy sources; natural resources; sustainable development; urbanization","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL","Rusu, T##Cristea, C##Rusu, T##Groze, IC##Stoica, L","[Rusu, Tiberiu; Rusu, Tudor] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Environm Engn & Sustainable Dev Entrepreneur, 103-105 Muncii Ave, Cluj Napoca, Romania.

Yet, empirical research in the field of education for sustainable development is underdeveloped, especially in an emerging Asian economy of Thailand. Thailand has progressed toward education for sustainable development with its sufficiency-based school movement to advance sustainability in education. It aims to develop and promote a whole-of-school approach to apply sufficiency thinking for sustainable development to all school activities from management and student activities to community partnerships. Sufficiency thinking is based on a framework of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy"" (SEP)-an alternative approach to sustainable development, as advocated by UNDP and resonated with UN SDG Goals. To advance the limited knowledge in the field, this research paper empirically investigates what school management practices/factors, based on the SEP theoretical framework, can significantly predict enhanced education for sustainable development in schools. Survey data stem from 240 schools in Thailand. Based on results of factor analysis, a research model for educational sustainability was emerged and proposed. Findings from multiple regression analysis suggest that SEP principles, namely virtues, prudence, stakeholder focus and enabling culture, are significant predictors of enhanced education for sustainable development in Thailand, possibly applicable in other countries.",NA,"Education; sustainable development; sustainability; SDG; sufficiency economy; Asia; Thailand","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Suriyankietkaew, S##Hallinger, P","[Suriyankietkaew, Suparak; Hallinger, Philip] Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, 69 VipawadeeRangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.

Flexible work arrangement (FWA) can be defined as a set of benefits provided by employer that lets employees to control over when and where they work outside of the standard arrangement. Although the concept of flexible work arrangements (FWAs) is quite widely analysed by scientific community during past decades, there is a lack of knowledge exploring the impact of flexible work practices on sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to examine how flexible work arrangements can contribute to sustainable development at different levels of abstraction. Research methodology includes comparative analysis and synthesis of scientific literature, modelling, and empirical research in the form of survey and semi-structured interview. Research revealed that FWAs, when implemented with care and preparation, have a positive influence on sustainability at different levels of abstraction: individual level, company level, and society level. Benefits of flexible work practices turn up through three interconnected domains: economic, environmental, and social.","JOB-SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; FLEXTIME; EMPLOYEE; TIME","flexible work arrangements; sustainability; sustainable development; employees; organization","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Ciarniene, R##Vienazindiene, M##Adamoniene, R","[Ciarniene, Ramune] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.

Indeed, there is growing evidence of a general misunderstanding regarding the challenges related to the climate change issue. More specifically, we point to evidence outlining sustainable development (SD) and climate change as complex meta-problems. This explains why current global environmental policies are inefficient in addressing the causes of SD and climate change and why they fail to induce sustainable practices in consumers and organizations. In this paper, we argue that the primary obstacles businesses face in adopting proper sustainable practices are found in their neoclassical business worldview and in the increased competition levels resulting from internationalization and market deregulation. To counter these obstacles, we suggest solutions that have the potential to bring true SD. First, we believe the use of specific economic tools such as sovereign funds, green investments and ethical financial indexes, can have significant effects on neoclassical businesses in stewarding them towards sustainable practices. Finally, we call for increased interdisciplinary interactions between the scientific community, policymakers and business leaders in order to better manage meta-problems related to climate change.","INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY; CORPORATIONS; PERSPECTIVE","Sustainable development; policy; meta-problems; interdisciplinarity","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Viens, N##Fortier, D","[Viens, Nicolas; Fortier, Denise] Bishops Univ, Lennoxville, PQ, Canada.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Allenby B, 2011, SUSTAIN SCI, V6, P119, DOI 10.1007/s11625-011-0134-4##Allenby B, 2009, J IND ECOL, V13, P168, DOI 10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00114.x##Bauer P., 2006, OBSERVING EARTH INT##Baumgartner RJ, 2010, SUSTAIN DEV, V18, P71, DOI 10.1002/sd.452##Benyus J, 2002, BIOMIMICRY INNOVATIO##CHEVALIER M, 1974, HUM RELAT, V27, P43, DOI 10.1177/001872677402700104##Coeure B., 2009, FAUT IL AVOIR PEUR F, P85##Consolandi C, 2009, J BUS ETHICS, V87, P185, DOI 10.1007/s10551-008-9793-1##COSTANZA R, 1991, ECOLOGICAL EC SCI MA##Delios A, 2010, ACAD MANAGE PERSPECT, V24, P25, DOI 10.5465/AMP.2010.52842949##EGRI C, 1996, HDB ORG STUDIES##Friedman Milton, 1970, NY TIMES MAGAZINE##GLADWIN TN, 1995, ACAD MANAGE REV, V20, P874, DOI 10.5465/amr.1995.9512280024##Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, 2016, 2016 GLOB SUST INV R##Goodstein ES, 2014, EC ENV##Hawken P., 1993, ECOLOGY COMMERCE DEC##Hemous D, 2016, J INT ECON, V103, P80, DOI 10.1016/j.jinteco.2016.09.001##Junghans P., 2008, GEOECONOMIE, V4, P51##Karyotis C., 2011, GEOECONOMIE, P131##Lertpratchya A.

Therefore, universities must create an education system that does not destroy the biosphere. More specifically, given that businesses are powerful institutions, leadership and sustainable development (SD) should be an integral part of the business curriculum. The current lack of educational content on SD is linked to several issues. First, we need to approach leadership education from a sustaincentric paradigm, thereby moving away from emphasizing profitability at the expense of a healthy ecological, social, and economic context. Second, there remains a paucity of theoretical and practical tools for educating leaders to take on the SD challenge. Indeed, there is confusion regarding how leadership relates to successful implementation of environmental sustainability. In this paper, we outline some guidelines for leadership and SD. Accordingly, we acknowledge the fundamental complexity of SD and question the potential for contributions from biomimicry. We join the call for combining voices from multidisciplinary perspectives, including the physical and social sciences, as a necessary first step in our quest to take on the SD challenge and conclude that leaders must integrate a form of 'shared leadership' where followers are empowered to improve ecological innovation and find ""green"" alternatives.",NA,"Leadership Education; Leadership and Sustainable Development","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Fortier, D##Viens, N","[Fortier, Denise; Viens, Nicolas] Bishops Univ, Lennoxville, PQ, Canada.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Allenby B, 1999, J IND ECOLOGY##Allenby B, 2009, J IND ECOLOGY##Allenby B, 2011, SUSTAIN SCI, V6, P119, DOI 10.1007/s11625-011-0134-4##Baumgartner R.

"J","WOS:000446321000006",2018,"Reframing the sustainable development goals to achieve sustainable development in the Anthropocene-a systems approach","Griggs et al. (2013) redefine sustainable development as ""development that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding Earth's life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depend."" We recommend this as the end goal that the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) should strive to achieve. Integration across the SDGs is less than what is required from a science perspective. Effective implementation of the SDGs will require States to attend to trade-offs and overlaps. We argue that continuous failure to address integration within the SDGs will jeopardize realization of this ultimate end goal. Therefore, we adopt a systems approach to identify gaps and connections across the goals and targets of the SDGs as well as leverage points for effective intervention. We triangulate across methods of critical analysis, conceptual modeling, and keyword network analysis to draw out seven ""overarching directions"" that could provide a prioritization framework to enhance efficient implementation of the SDGs. Our results identify main gaps as exclusion of key actors (e.g., corporations) and issues (e.g., intergenerational equity and population); inadequate reconciliation of economic growth with maintaining the Earth system; and deficient consideration of the relationship with international law. Conceptual mapping identifies education and innovation; governance and implementation; sustainable consumption and production; and addressing the key drivers of climate change as key leverage points. The keyword analysis highlights greater integration within the SDGs than what appears at face value. Keywords ""access,"" ""women,"" ""resources,""and ""finance"" feature across the SDGs and provide further leverage points. Targeting these issues will facilitate realization of a high proportion of SDGs and correspondingly could have a disproportional impact on effective SDG implementation. We conclude that the success of the SDGs needs to be evaluated by the extent to which it contributes to human development while advancing protection of ""planetary must-haves"" for current and future generations.","CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; FERTILITY; HEALTH","implementation; sustainable development goals; systems approach","ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY","Lim, MML##Jorgensen, PS##Wyborn, CA","[Lim, Michelle M.

"J","WOS:000446770200302",2018,"An Application of Sustainable Development in Indigenous People's Revival: The History of an Indigenous Tribe's Struggle in Taiwan","Community development is seen as a crucial factor to realize sustainable development and vice versa, and for indigenous peoples in particular due to their associations with nature and natural resources. However, historical exploitation of indigenous peoples has resulted in their underachievement worldwide. The popularization of the concept of sustainable development followed a series of international treaties and conventions that shed light on indigenous peoples' revival. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's notion of the power-knowledge relationship, this article uses a case study of an indigenous tribe, the Smangus in Taiwan, to demonstrate how a politically, socially and economically disadvantaged community incorporates their traditional norms and customs into the notion of sustainable development and reinterprets it to adapt the community's conditions. By re-uniting the community and establishing a cooperative organization, the community has revived cohesion in their community. The community's conduct is investigated through the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030, and the article illustrates how it fulfils three Targets and the extent to which they are fulfilled. To conclude, Smangus' case remind us of the importance of achieving sustainable development goals on micro- and local levels, and the value of empowering local communities to pursue their own sustainable development goals according to their circumstances. This article ends with suggestions for future research, and suggests that more studies using such a bottom-up approach to sustainable development would help to accumulate knowledge and experiences to establish a pattern of success to help other disadvantaged communities, draw focus to the need to bridge the policy gaps between the United Nations and local communities, and recall attention to the role of micro- and local communities to achieve sustainable development goals.","TOURISM DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; COMMUNITY-DEVELOPMENT; GOVERNMENTALITY; EMPOWERMENT","sustainable development; sustainable development goals; community development; indigenous people","SUSTAINABILITY","Yu, CY","[Yu, Cheng-Yu] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Dev Management, Taipei 11114, Taiwan.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Akinsemolu AA, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V182, P139, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.081##[Anonymous], 2018, SUST DEV GOALS REP##[Anonymous], 1992, AG 21##Assembly G., 2010, UN DECL RIGHTS IND P##Beltran J., 2000, BEST PRACTICE PROTEC##Blake J., 1999, LOCAL ENVIRON, V4, P257, DOI [10.1080/13549839908725599, DOI 10.1080/13549839908725599]##Borrini-Feyerabend G, 2004, BEST PRACTICE PORTEC##Bradshaw TK, 2007, COMMUNITY DEV, V38, P7, DOI 10.1080/15575330709490182##Brundtland G., 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE RE, V1, P59##BURGER J, 1987, REPORT FRONTIER STAT##Burger J., 1990, GAIA ATLAS 1 PEOPLES##Cao C.-Q., 2003, SUSTAIN IND DEV J, V8, P63##Chan S.-K, 2011, TAIWAN J INDIG STUD, V4, P183##Chang H.-M, 2013, WORLD ACAD SCI ENG T, V83, P1072##Chang HM, 2013, WORLD ACAD SCI ENG T, V77, P1361##Chen J.-J., 2002, THESIS##Chen Y.-L, THERE IS GARBAGE WAT##Cheng Y., 2006, THESIS##Colchester M., 1997, Social change and conservation: environmental politics and impacts of national parks and protected areas., P97##Davey A.

These are mainly based on the pursuit of synergy in the three basic areas of activities, i.e., in the economic, social, and environmental dimensions as well as in the maintenance of natural resources. The implementation of these activities is connected with the necessity of incurring financial expenditures, which the government (public sector) does not have in the required value. Therefore, in the process of sustainable development for which the government is responsible, the active participation of the financial sector (banks) is necessary. Achieving results within the alliance of the concept of sustainable development requires the setting of a kind of contract, the parties of which are the government, society, and financial institutions. The purpose of the conducted research is to indicate by which means the government can stimulate economic growth towards its sustainable development.","GROWTH; INTERMEDIATION; FINANCE; FDI","public finance; sustainable development","SUSTAINABILITY","Alinska, A##Filipiak, BZ##Kosztowniak, A","[Alinska, Agnieszka] Warsaw Sch Econ, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.

"J","WOS:000447084200005",2018,"Fostering innovation performance from a sustainable development perspective: towards a research agenda","The benefits of sustainability-driven innovation and their impacts on performance under the three dimensions of economic, social and environmental performance has often not been adequately captured. This paper acknowledges the gap and presents a conceptual framework that helps identify the determinants towards fostering innovation performance and explains the relationship with sustainability practices through the pursuit of the exploitation of existing competencies and exploration of new opportunities from a sustainable development perspective. Their eventual impact on innovation performance is assessed from the dynamic capabilities theory perspective. The research contributes to the field of sustainable innovation and provides a roadmap for organisations to bridge the sustainability gap. It provides a holistic framework that examines the relationships of stakeholder sustainability orientation, market orientation, exploration and exploitation regarding innovation performance and its eventual impact on sustainable development. The research helps to confirm that the pursuit of a sustainability agenda is indeed worthwhile for organisations.","FIRM-LEVEL ANALYSIS; MARKET ORIENTATION; CUSTOMER ORIENTATION; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; PRODUCT INNOVATION; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION; KNOWLEDGE; AMBIDEXTERITY","exploration; exploitation; sustainable innovation; sustainability practices; innovation performance; sustainable development; sustainability gap","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Krishna, PVG##Lorsuwannarat, T","[Krishna, P.

"J","WOS:000448660400016",2018,"Sacred Places and Sustainable Development","Religious beliefs are not only profound, some of them are also pervasive, persistent and persuasive. It follows that the cultural and religious experiences of communities often play a central role in determining their worldviews and the ways in which they understand their own circumstances. These worldviews, it follows, can thereby assist in providing narratives for community development in places that have particular meaning to these communities and individuals within them, and thereby enhance the long-term success of such initiatives. One often-overlooked aspect in research up until recently is the role that these often sacred places can play in sustainable development. This paper undertakes a study of development spaces situated in sacred places, in this case of a women's Buddhist monastery on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, devoted to gender equity. It begins with an overview of research pertaining to religion and development, religion in contemporary societies, and sacred places, and concludes with an analysis of the case study data that recognizes the need to consider the significance of sacred places, and narratives attached to them, in sustainable community development.","RELIGION; POLITICS","religion; sacred places; development; gender equality; Sustainable Development Goals; Buddhism; bhikkhuni; Thailand","RELIGIONS","Halafoff, A##Clarke, M","[Halafoff, Anna; Clarke, Matthew] Deakin Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Burwood 3125, Australia.","Religion","Religion","Ammerman Nancy T., 2007, EVERYDAY RELIG OBSER##Ammerman NancyTatom., 2013, SACRED STORIES SPIRI##Beck U., 2006, COSMOPOLITAN VISION##BECKFORD JA, 1990, SOCIOL ANAL, V51, P1, DOI 10.2307/3711337##Bhabha Homi., 1994, LOCATION CULTURE##Bouma G.D., 2006, AUSTR SOUL RELIG SPI##Bouma GD, 2017, J ACAD STUDY RELIG, V30, P129, DOI 10.1558/jasr.34826##Caritas in Veritate (CV), 2009, ENC LETT CAR VER SUP##Casanova Jose, 1994, PUBLIC RELIG MODERN##Chidester D., 1995, AM SACRED SPACE, P1##Clarke M, 2013, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON DEVELOPMENT AND RELIGION, P1, DOI 10.4337/9780857933577##Clarke M, 2011, DEVELOPMENT AND RELIGION: THEOLOGY AND PRACTICE, P1##Clarke M., 2017, RELIG DEV ASIA PACIF##Clarke M, 2014, EUR J DEV RES, V26, P692, DOI 10.1057/ejdr.2013.67##Deneulin Severine, 2009, RELIG DEV REWRITING##Dhammananda B., 2014, EMINENT BUDDHIST WOM, P61##Dhammananda Bhikkhuni.

The article presents the concept of sustainable consumption with direct reference to tourism that allowed the authors to define contemporary changes on tourism services market, highlighting the importance of protection of the natural environment in contemporary choices of consumers. In the authors' opinion, the focusing of consumers tourism services on this protection is in line with the global changes of consumers' behaviour that are visible in other services sectors. The authors also emphasize that this changes are particularly important for tourism. This relates to the universal recognition of tourism as a form of an environmentally friendly economic activity that over the years caused the irresponsible management of natural resources for development and consequently led to numerous irreversible changes. According to the authors, the implementation of the principles of sustainable tourism development by consumption is not only the element which decides on the development, it could be an important distinguishing feature in comparison to other services sectors. By referring to the concept of sustainable consumption the authors also emphasize the important role of tourism industry in implementation of sustainable development in tourism.",NA,"sustainable consumption; sustainable consumption in tourism; sustainable development; sustainable tourism; tourism development","PRACE KOMISJI GEOGRAFII PRZEMYSLU POLSKIEGO TOWARZYSTWA GEOGRAFICZNEGO-STUDIES OF THE INDUSTRIAL GEOGRAPHY COMMISSION OF THE POLISH GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY","Hendel, M##Zemla, M","[Hendel, Marek] Uniwersytet Ekon Wroclawiu, Wydzial Ekon Zarzadzania & Turystyki Jeleniej Gor, Ul Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.

Development of innovative and sustainable economy is an aim for the whole society in the European Union. Three pillars of sustainable development: economic growth, environmental management and social inclusion are fundamental and occur across all economic sectors. Predominantly, they influence cities e.g. fast urbanization process, infrastructure, energy development as well as transportation. Cities in Europe are precursors of the transformation towards a low carbon and resource efficient economy. City authorities are planning and acting towards a more sustainable future characterized by investing in innovative, integrated technologies and services such as buildings, mobility, lighting and broadband communications. Aim: The aim of the article is to present challenges facing European cities in the light of sustainable development. The paper explores trends in regional policy undertaken by the European Union relating to sustainable development. The first part outlines the global vision of present and future goals of sustainable development in the world. The next part focuses on the cities and challenges they face referring to sustainable and smart development. Results: The conducted research shows sustainable development as still valid, important and topical. The research indicates that the structures of the EU are not the exclusively supportive and responsible for sustainable development in Europe. The entities such as cities play a very important role in achieving sustainability. Numerous European cities are still establishing programs integrating the energy, transport and ICT sectors in order to deliver more efficient services to their inhabitants. Finally, more and more cities are going to become smart in the nearest future.","SMART CITIES","sustainable development; smart cities; innovation","EKONOMIA I PRAWO-ECONOMICS AND LAW","Derlukiewicz, N##Mempel-Sniezyk, A","[Derlukiewicz, Niki] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Macroecon, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.

This is due to the fact that sustainable development is a pressing issue that requires immediate action and changes from governments, industry, and society as whole. This article reviews the literature on innovations that can lead to transformations in individuals, organizations, supply chains, and communities toward a sustainable future. Although many of the articles explored in this review report on existing urgent environmental and social issues, their findings, recommendations, and contributions are encouraging as we make progress toward a sustainable society through innovation and change. This article reviews the diversity of innovation for Sustainable Development in the literature, proposes a typology of such a phenomenon, provides an overview of key articles based on the primary subjects they address, and identifies a series of recommendations for the future development of the field.

"J","WOS:000451531700010",2018,"Intergenerational Equity and the Sustainable Development Goals","The contribution of the present research is to link the global consensus in international legal scholarship on the principle of intergenerational equity to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The methodology used is, first, to provide a literature review of theories of intergenerational equity developed in international law scholarship, followed by a textual analysis of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution that contains the SDGs. To place the SDGs in their proper context, an overview is provided of the most important declarations on sustainable development of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), and outcome documents of the most important World Conferences on sustainable development organized under the auspices of the United Nations. Two general conclusions can be drawn from the present research: in international law scholarship and in the SDGs and previous declarations, the earth is generally seen as a resource, to be used by present and future people, and not as something warranting respect regardless of its worth to human beings. Second, the main challenge is to find a proper balance between intergenerational equity-present and future people-and intragenerational equity-the rich and the poor of the present generation.","FUTURE GENERATIONS; OBLIGATIONS","United Nations General Assembly; intergenerational equity; sustainable development; international law; sustainable development goals","SUSTAINABILITY","Spijkers, O","[Spijkers, Otto] Univ Utrecht, Sch Law, Dept Int & European Law, Newtonlaan 201,Room 3A-36, NL-3584 BH Utrecht, Netherlands.

"J","WOS:000451531700075",2018,"Sustainable Financing for Sustainable Development: Understanding the Interrelations between Public Investment and Sovereign Debt","This study investigates the causal relationship between public investment and sovereign debt (i.e., external and domestic public debt) with respect to the limits of public-debt sustainability for four countries with the highest GDP (i.e., the United States, China, Japan, Germany) during the period of 2000-2015. In summary, this study establishes quantitative evidence based on empirical findings to support the claim that sovereign debt is harmful to the financing of public infrastructure if it breaches certain thresholds, as proposed in this study, and according to the literature. By this approach, the findings enable us to make recommendations about the need for mobilizing domestic resources and innovating new financial models to promote sustainable development within the limits of sustainable public debt. In short, this paper concludes that performing a project for sustainable development by implementing unsustainable financing models will always end up with unsustainable economic outcomes.","EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE;

"J","WOS:000451713900018",2018,"Practical Approaches Toward Sustainable Development in Iranian Green Construction","Developed nations acknowledge sustainable development as a legal right for current and future generations. Although instances of domestic and international efforts are prevalent, there is a long way to go before accomplishing developmental ideals. A practical approach for realizing the vital goals of sustainable development is of the utmost importance. In effect, the construction sector requires extensive forward-looking studies for strategizing, building and granting a sustainable future. The inconsistency between the goals and activities of different sectors is a main impediment upon undertaking sustainable development's goals; decision and lawmakers must consider the purpose and interests of the building industry on a micro and macro level. This paper is a brief review for understanding the concept of sustainable development and illustrates some of the international efforts, and highlights them for decision makers. Using the 'PESTLE' analysis technique, external and internal factors influencing sustainability in the Iranian construction sector were identified. Interviews were conducted with experts using the 'Snowball' research method due to the lack of knowledgeable respondents in the subject area. 11 Practical steps needed in Iran were recommended and sorted by their importance to make this vision a reality. The results can be generalized to other disciplines as well.","COMPONENTS","Sustainable Development; Sustainable Construction; PESTLE","CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN","Darabpour, MR##Darabpour, M##Sardroud, JM##Tabarsa, G##Smallwood, J","[Darabpour, M.

"J","WOS:000453204600012",2017,"SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: PARADIGM FOR THE FUTURE","Over the past 30-40 years, the concept of sustainable development has gained in complexity and comprehensiveness, a theoretical approach has been developed, sustainability goals and quantitative indicators have been proposed. The article identifies three stages of this evolution. At the present stage, the concept has become a complex socio-ecological and economic phenomenon, both in theory and in its practical interpretations. Its recognition by the United Nations and all the countries involved as a background for humanity allows to speak about the sustainable development as a kind of consensus official global development paradigm in the 21st century. It is acknowledged that the formation of a ""green"" economy is the basis of transition to sustainability. The article analyzes three fundamental problems, the solution of which is essential for the development of humanity, the global economy and national economies, both in theory and in practice: well-being and sustainable development; quantitative interpretation, indicators of sustainable development; transformation of the energy sector as a key to sustainable development. The ambiguity of the Kuznets curve interpretation is demonstrated. The growth of the developed countries' welfare and the improvement of ecological situation in the countries themselves can lead to an increase in global environmental impact (in particular, the growth of their ""carbon footprint"" shows this). Currently, a variety of indicator systems, composite indices, adjusted traditional indicators to measure sustainable development are used. The article analyzes the United Nations' goals of sustainable development (2015), adopted for the 2016-2030 period. The Adjusted Net Savings Index developed by the World Bank experts is promising (especially for countries with large natural capital). Crucial for the transition to sustainable development, ""green"" and low-carbon economy is the solution of energy problems. Global trends show an increase in the share of renewable energy and the competitiveness of renewable energy sources.",NA,"sustainable development; the components of sustainable development; ""green"" economy; the environmental Kuznets curve; sustainable development goals; sustainable development indicators; low-carbon economy; climate change","MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA","Bobylev, SN","[Bobylev, Sergei N.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, 1 Leninskie Gory, Moscow 119991, Russia.","International Relations","International Relations","[Anonymous], 1989, OUR COMMON FUTURE RE##[Anonymous], 2011, HUM DEV REP 2011##[Anonymous], 1992, UN C ENV DEV RIO DE##[Anonymous], 2014, FOR WORLD RUSS EN DE##China's Future Generation, 2014, CHIN FUT GEN ASS MAX##Declaration on Green Growth, 2009, M COUNC MIN LEV 25 J, P2##Living Planet, 2010, LIVING PLANET 2010 B##Meadows D.

This is a well-known composite indicator, composed of 21 indicators, grouped in seven categories, covering environmental, social and economic wellbeing dimensions. Thirteen European countries recently incorporated into the European Union (NEUC) are considered as a reference. The study covers the period 2006-2016. The South American Region features significant natural resources and plays an important role in the global economy. However, there is concern about the long-term sustainability of social and economic development, given the high rate of economic growth based on the production of low added-value primary products. Sustainable development requires reasonable balance between economic, social and environmental performance, as well as a sustained and balanced increase in performance associated with those fundamental dimensions. Moreover, it is important to agree on minimum performance levels for all performance indicators, taking into account particular social, economic and environmental realities. SAC feature a clear imbalance in some categories affecting the economic, social and environmental wellbeing dimensions, showing either stagnation or significant decrease in recent years. It can be concluded that in the light of findings reported here, South American countries are far from being on the pathway towards sustainable development.","COMPOSITE INDICATORS; DIMENSIONS; SSI","Sustainable development; Composite indicators; SSI; South America; European Union","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Gonzalez-Cabezas, D##Zaror, C##Herrera, MA","[Gonzalez-Cabezas, D.] Univ Cordoba, Doctorate Program Nat Resources & Sustainable Man, Concepcion, Spain.

"J","WOS:000454041400008",2018,"Sustainable Development in Russia's Northern Regions: Labor Dimension","The article points out that sustainable development is not the ultimate goal, but a dynamic process of adaptation, cognition and activity. We show that the transition to sustainable development is preconditioned by historical circumstances; we reveal the chronology of the concepts of sustainable development from the Brundtland Report to the 2030 Agenda. We analyze six international systems of sustainable development indicators; each of the systems contains social-labor indicators and indicators of living standards. We emphasize that the common disadvantage of all the systems is that their indicators are poorly adapted to Russian statistics. We consider it important to establish a set of labor indicators and develop a methodology to assess sustainable development. The novelty of our research lies in fact that we use our own approach to the assessment of sustainable development with the use of labor indicators. Labor stability is estimated according to four factors that include twelve labor indicators. On the basis of an expert survey, we determine the impact of each labor factor and indicator on sustainable development. We calculate the integral index of labor stability, and use it to rank all the Northern regions according to the degree of stability: critical, low, medium, high. The results obtained allow us to conclude that labor stability in the Northern regions increased significantly from 2000 to 2015; there is no region with a critical degree of labor stability, it is low only in Tuva, and five regions have a high degree of stability. At the first stage of the research, we propose a method for assessing demographic stability using two approaches: ranking regions on the basis of demographic indicators and on the basis of an integral index. It is planned to develop a methodology for forecasting sustainable development based on demographic and labor indicators.

The growth of production rates by large agroholdings, which is mainly specialized on the crop production, does not contribute to the development of rural areas. The purpose of the article is to develop measures to ensure the sustainable development of rural areas. In the article, based on the method of comparative analysis, various aspects of programs on sustainable development of rural areas have been researched; economic development of rural territories for 2010-2016 has been studied on the basis of sociological and statistical data.

The policy agendas audited include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (AfSD), the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework. An auditing matrix of 21 indicators was developed through a critical discourse analysis. Among the indicators identified were: violence against women; capacity building and access to technology; involvement in leadership and decision-making; access to finance, land and other property ownership; inheritance; gender equality; and full access to job opportunities and equal pay. The main findings were that the development agendas address women and girls, although to varying degrees, with the 2030 AfSD emerging as outstanding in this regard. However, there were inherent weaknesses in the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework regarding land rights. Further work is needed in following up the promises from these development agendas.","POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT; EMPOWERMENT; PROGRAMS; POVERTY; GENDER","gender; policy; stakeholder engagement; sustainable development; women","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Nhamo, G##Muchuru, S##Nhamo, S","[Nhamo, Godwell; Muchuru, Shepherd] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, POB 392, Pretoria, South Africa.

To support the Ivory Coast Government in this process, we have developed the Treshold21-iSDG model, which integrates long-term social, economic and environmental policy analyses for SDG attainment. Specifically, we assess the impact of the implementation of the National Prospective Study (NPS) on achievement of the 17 SDGs, and identify necessary strategic adjustments. We compare SDG attainment under three scenarios: business-as-usual, NPS, and an ""SDG"" scenario that includes adjustments for critical aspects of SDGs not sufficiently covered by the NPS. The analysis identifies cross-sector impacts of policies and highlights the benefits of coordinated implementation of comprehensive and coherent SDG strategies. Such findings emphasize the importance of integrated simulation models to support planning of SDG strategies and to complement information provided by stakeholder engagement and other sector-specific or qualitative tools.","MODEL","environmental policy; iSDG; Ivory Coast; sustainable development goals; system dynamics; T21","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Pedercini, M##Zuellich, G##Dianati, K##Arquitt, S","[Pedercini, Matteo; Zuellich, Gunda; Dianati, Kaveh; Arquitt, Steven] Millennium Inst, Arlington, VA USA.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","Allen C, 2017, SUSTAIN DEV, V25, P372, DOI 10.1002/sd.1662##Allen C, 2016, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V66, P199, DOI 10.1016/j.envsci.2016.09.008##Barlas Y, 1996, SYST DYNAM REV, V12, P183, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199623)12:3<183::AID-SDR103>3.0.CO;2-4##Barney GO, 2002, SYST DYNAM REV, V18, P123, DOI 10.1002/sdr.233##Brimont L., 2017, IDDRI ISSUE DRIEF##Desanker P., 2001, CLIMATE CHANGE 2001, P489##ICSU, 2015, REV TARG SUST DEV GO##Kaufmann D., 2010, WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE, V5430##Le Blanc D, 2015, SUSTAIN DEV, V23, P176, DOI 10.1002/sd.1582##Lettenmeier M., 2012, P FOOD SYST DYN, P584##MI (Millennium Institute), 2016, THRESH 21 T21 ISDG M##Nilsson M, 2016, NATURE, V534, P320, DOI 10.1038/534320a##O'Connor D., 2016, UNIVERSALITY POLICY##OECD, 2016, BETT POL SUST DEV 20##Pedercini M., 2005, POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTI##Pedercini M., 2010, SOCIOECON PLAN SCI, V44, P89, DOI DOI 10.1016/j.seps.2009.08.002##Raskin P., 1997, COMPREHENSIVE ASSESS##Republique de Cote d'Ivoire, 2016, ET NAT PROSP COT IV##Sachs J., 2016, SDG INDEX DASHBOARDS##Scheyvens R, 2016, SUSTAIN DEV, V24, P371, DOI 10.1002/sd.1623##Schmidt-Traub G, 2015, INVESTMENT NEEDS ACH##U.S. EPA, 2017, PART MATT PM POLL##UN (United Nations), 2016, ECN320162REV1 UN STA##UNEP, 2014, US MOD GREEN EC POL##United Nations, 2015, GLOB SUST DEV REP 20##Vladimirova K, 2016, SUSTAIN DEV, V24, P254, DOI 10.1002/sd.1626",14,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM4","no","SDG.17#SDG.12"

The empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. Of the six hypotheses tested, it is not feasible to assess the hypothesis on resource-wealth because of issues in the degrees of freedom. For the remaining hypotheses, the following findings are established. (i) Hypothesis 1 postulating that middle-income countries have a lower level of persistence in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is valid for CO2 per-capita emissions, CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production and CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption. (ii) Hypothesis 2 that countries on the edge of French civil law is valid for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity, but not for CO2 per-capita emissions. (iii) Hypothesis 3 on the postulation that politically unstable countries reflect more persistence is valid for CO2 per-capita emissions. (iv) Hypothesis 5 on the propensity for landlocked countries to be associated with more persistence in CO2 emissions is valid for CO2 per-capita emissions but not for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption. (v) Hypothesis 6 maintaining that Christianity-dominated countries are more environmentally friendly with regard to CO2 emissions is valid for CO2 per-capita emissions but not for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity.

Numerous single indicators have been established to monitor progress toward sustainable development; however, the need for benchmarking the degree of sustainability of countries triggered the creation of the SDG Index, which originally compiled 77 indicators and has evolved to 99 at present. This research analyzes the suitability of applying this composite index for assessing the fulfillment of the 2030 Agenda. The lack of information resulted in 60% of the SDG indicators being disregarded in the SDG Index. The scores obtained through the application of this index clustered UN countries according to specific geographic areas, highlighting the need for developing regional SDG Indices to emphasize the achievement of lower-performing goals.",NA,"2030 Agenda; SDG Index; sustainability indicators; sustainable development; sustainable development goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Diaz-Sarachaga, JM##Jato-Espino, D##Castro-Fresno, D","[Manuel Diaz-Sarachaga, Jose; Jato-Espino, Daniel; Castro-Fresno, Daniel] Univ Cantabria, GITECO Res Grp, Ave Castros 44, E-39005 Santander, Spain.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","[Anonymous], 1996, BAR SUST WHAT ITS US##Basiago A.

Yet achieving coherence is difficult. This paper examines the extent to which the Policy Coherence for Development movement offers guidelines for aligning national development priorities with global development priorities. This qualitative paper focuses on alignment between South Africa's National Development and its Medium-Term Strategic Frameworks and the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. Based on an analysis of policy documents and peer-reviewed research on the Policy Coherence for Development movement, it is argued that five guidelines might be of relevance for South Africa, namely (i) prioritizing political buy-in, (ii) safeguarding country ownership of development priorities, (iii) using and improving existing institutional structures and processes, (iv) stimulating cooperation across government departments by using an issue-based approach and (v) including a long-term and transnational perspective when considering policy impacts.","PROGRESS; RISE","2030 agenda; PCD; policy coherence for development; SDGs; sustainable development goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Fourie, W","[Fourie, Willem] Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, Lynnwood Rd, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","Chandler D, 2007, J INT RELAT DEV, V10, P362, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jird.1800135##Department of Planning Monitoring and Evaluation [Internet], 2012, MED TERM STRAT FRAM##Frost L, 2016, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V94, P393, DOI 10.2471/BLT.16.171710##Global Partnership for Effective Development Co operation, 2011, OUTC DOC 4 HIGH LEV##Greenhill R, 2016, RETHINK INT DEV, P137, DOI 10.1057/978-1-137-55357-7_10##Ikhlayel M, 2017, SUSTAIN DEV, V25, P467, DOI 10.1002/sd.1683##Kim EM, 2013, J INT DEV, V25, P787, DOI 10.1002/jid.2938##Knoll A., 2014, 163 EUR CTR DEV POL##Le Blanc D, 2015, SUSTAIN DEV, V23, P176, DOI 10.1002/sd.1582##Moomaw WR, 2017, GLOB POLICY, V8, P73, DOI 10.1111/1758-5899.12350##National Planning Commission, 2011, NAT DEV PLAN VIS 203##National Planning Commission The Presidency Republic of South Africa, 2011, DIAGN OV##O'Donoghue T.A., 2007, PLANNING YOUR QUALIT##OECD, 2012, OECD STRAT DEV##OECD (Organization for Economic Co operation and Development), 2016, BETT POL SUST DEV NE##OECD (Organization for Economic Co operation and Development), 2002, FIN COMM OECD COUNC##OECD (Organization for Economic Co operation and Development), 2008, OECD MIN DECL POL CO##Olsen G.

In addition to financial profit, organizations are setting themselves new goals, focusing on individual, communal, and environmental-friendly performance and development. One of the disciplines that is promoting ""green"" organizations is Sustainable Human Resource Management (SHRM). Sustainable development goals (SDGs) are achieved through the adoption of new ecological techniques by the organization's human capital and by the integration of innovative sustainable strategies. This systematic literature review examines the key role of SHRM in developing a sustainable work environment and in facilitating the attainment of SDGs. Based on a selection of empirical and conceptual articles, this review identifies the antecedents and outcomes of SHRM and highlights the obstacles to sustainable implementation not only at the level of the firm, but also from an international perspective. Four propositions are formulated that might be empirically tested in future studies. Research gaps in the existing literature are identified and potential future directions are suggested for further research in the field of sustainable management.","SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; OF-THE-ART; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; GREEN HRM; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONS; COMPANIES; EMPLOYEES; BEHAVIOR","Sustainable human resource management; SHRM; Sustainable development goals SDGs; Green HRM; Social, ethical, and ecological performances; Sustainable development","RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING","Chams, N##Garcia-Blandon, J","[Chams, Nour; Garcia-Blandon, Josep] Univ Ramon Llull, IQS Sch Management, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain.","Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences","Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Aguinis H, 2012, J MANAGE, V38, P932, DOI 10.1177/0149206311436079##Appelbaum E., 2000, MANUFACTURING ADVANT, DOI [10.2307/259189, DOI 10.2307/259189]##Arulrajah A.A., 2016, INT BUS RES, V9, P153, DOI [10.5539/ibr.v9n12p153, DOI 10.5539/IBR.V9N12P153]##Bansal P, 2000, ACAD MANAGE J, V43, P717, DOI 10.2307/1556363##Barnes P.

Today's environment is highly dependent on technological capabilities. Tracking contemporary technological development is becoming crucial at both micro and macro level. One of the major revolutions in modern business is switching from traditional to digital business models for achieving higher competitiveness level. Digitalization is one of the primary impetus of today's development. To accept and implement these changes, it is important to highlight the macromarketing role in this process. It is necessary to have concrete measures for identifying the shortcomings, good practices, and track the development. For this purpose, European Commission developed DESI to measure digital performance of European Union countries. This paper examines the DESI methodology and observes how the digital performance of EU affects main sustainable development components: economic, social, and environmental. Thus, the paper explores the correlations of DESI and other composite indices that measure sustainability components. Besides, the research examined the relationships between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and digital performance. The paper highlights the importance of digitalization as another crucial component of society's sustainable development.","NATIONAL CULTURE; TECHNOLOGY; VALUES","digitalization; sustainable development; performance indicators; society; macromarketing","ZBORNIK RADOVA EKONOMSKOG FAKULTETA U RIJECI-PROCEEDINGS OF RIJEKA FACULTY OF ECONOMICS","Jovanovic, M##Dlacic, J##Okanovic, M","[Jovanovic, Milica; Okanovic, Milan] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.

"J","WOS:000454572000004",2018,"Sustainable Development of Fishermen Settlement Based on Cultural Aspects","Most fishermen have low wages and tend to have fewer opportunities to live properly. Consequently, fishermen settlements are often gentrified in urban development, especially in developing countries. Indonesia, one of the developing countries with the longest inhabited coastline, has recently encountered this problem. The sustainable solutions needed to preserve their culture should be implemented while improving the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the concept of sustainable development for fishermen settlement that would be based on local maritime culture. Culture is highlighted because of its roles to drive the surrounding environment for quality improvement in fishermen settlement. To explore sustainable culture especially maritime culture in fishermen context some guiding variables are needed. The aim of this research is to indicate how culture supports the sustainable development concept in fishermen settlement. The method used in this research is exploring theories by descriptive qualitative analysis. By using the theory of culture in sustainable development, the paper assessed maritime culture and settlement. The result of this paper is that culture is a guiding variable in the sustainable development of fishermen settlement, which consists of five layers of cultural aspects, detailed in the maritime culture. This variable can be used in further research on fishermen settlement based on cultural aspects.",NA,"culture-based sustainable development; marine livelihood; fishermen settlement","JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING","Sharvina, AN##Faqih, M##Santosa, HR##Hayati, A","[Sharvina, Ainun Nurin; Faqih, Muhammad; Santosa, Happy Ratna; Hayati, Arina] Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember ITS, Dept Architecture, Surabaya, Indonesia.","Geography","Geography","Al-Masroori H.

The present study argues for the need to focus on how this should be implemented and to acknowledge the criticality of developing individuals' competencies to support such integration. The purpose of this paper is to explore the integration of lean and energy efficiency practices and provide practical examples of such integration. This study is explorative in nature and based on a qualitative research approach. Primary evidence was collected through an interview study of 19 participants in a lean energy course, and through a participant observation at a company workshop following up the program results. Secondary evidence was collected on the development and evaluation of this course. By operationalizing sustainability through energy efficiency and combining with lean principles, organizations can exploit continuous improvement efforts for sustainable development. This paper focuses on professional education as a component for integrating improvement initiatives and sustainable development. Whilst professional education enables individual learning, organization-wide efforts are needed to follow up on the educational program and support a scaling-up of lean energy. The scaling-up means that the organization itself encourages the use of principles and tools to identify and remove energy waste and support a move from local practices to shared experience.","SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC CONSENSUS; GREEN; OPERATIONS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; QUALITY; ISSUES","lean; energy efficiency improvement; continuous improvement; sustainable development; professional education; organizational renewal","SUSTAINABILITY","Halldorsson, A##Gremyr, I##Winter, A##Taghahvi, N","[Halldorsson, Arni; Gremyr, Ida; Taghahvi, Naghmeh] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Serv Management & Logist, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.

The Agenda document consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which among many other tasks, intend to eradicate poverty and create better health conditions in both developed and developing countries. But despite the need for and the relevance of the SDGs, it is unclear how they may help to address present and future sustainability challenges. Based on the need to shed some light on such a relationship, this paper describes each of the SDGs, and offers an analysis of the extent to which their implementation may offer support to ongoing attempts to handle some of the pressing problems seen in pursuing sustainable development. Three case studies are presented to show in practice how best the SDGs can be handled. The paper concludes that the process of implementing the SDGs offers unrivalled opportunities to advance equal opportunity and foster economic empowerment, helping countries to promote the cause of sustainable development in their territories, hence benefiting their populations.","ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE","Sustainability; sustainable development; sustainable development goals; case studies and challenges","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Filho, WL##Tripathi, SK##Guerra, JBSODA##Gine-Garriga, R##Lovren, VO##Willats, J","[Filho, W.

For this purpose, the state agrarian policy should be aimed at achieving three goals: 1) food security of the state; 2) solving of social and environmental problems in rural areas; and, 3) the transformation of the agrarian sector into a highly effective, competitive domestic and foreign market economy sector of the state. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to study the legal framework for the sustainable rural development of Ukraine by analyzing the state agricultural policy in this area. The article is dedicated to the study of sustainable development's legal aspects in Ukrainian rural areas. The author clarifies the essence of the concept of sustainable rural development, analyzes the international legislation and legislation of Ukraine in this area. It is noted that the state agrarian policy in Ukraine should focus primarily on ensuring legal, economic and organizational conditions for the development of rural diversification and public-private partnerships. The essence of rural diversification is revealed and its directions are investigated. Legal provision of rural tourism in Ukraine is analyzed in detail. The model of public-private partnership and its potential in the field of rural development is explored. The author concludes that legislation in the field of sustainable rural development is at the stage of formation and proposes a complex of changes aimed at its improvement.",NA,"Sustainable Development; Rural development; Diversification; Non-farm rural activities; Rural tourism; Public-Private Partnership","FUTURE OF FOOD-JOURNAL ON FOOD AGRICULTURE AND SOCIETY","Kulchii, I","[Kulchii, Inna] Yaroslav Mudryi Natl Law Univ, Dept Land & Agr Law, Pushkinska 77, Kharkov, Ukraine.","Food Science & Technology","Food Science & Technology","Balyuk N.

This study aims to first conduct a review of existing sustainability frameworks; second, conduct a stakeholder analysis for port city sustainable development. The case studies of two major port cities in ChinaGuangzhou and Shenzhen, are conducted. According to the findings, a structured framework with main categories of economic, social and environmental indicators would be recommended for port cities. Dealing with diversified stakeholders and their interests is a major challenge for policy makers to overcome but opportunities do co-exist. Policy makers of Guangzhou and Shenzhen have made progress in balancing economic, social, and environmental interests in recent years. This study has taken a step forward in the research area, with a view to provide reference to stakeholders and governments in progressing towards sustainable development in port cities.","MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; CITIES; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; SINGAPORE","port city; sustainable development; sustainability framework; stakeholder; Belt and Road Initiative","SUSTAINABILITY","Lam, JSL##Yap, WY","[Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Maritime Energy & Sustainable Dev Ctr Excellence, Singapore 639798, Singapore.

These are (a) international policy documents which shaped ESD, (b) the academic discourse in the field of ESD and (c) students and teachers. SD is a complex concept, and it can be interpreted in several ways. This paper adopts a holistic approach to SD, according to which SD is considered an integrated concept of three dimensions, namely the environment, the economy and the society. The significance of the holistic approach to the SD concept is emphasized in the recent international policy documents and by the academic discourse, as well. However, teachers and students do not hold yet a holistic understanding of the concept. The purpose of this paper is to discuss this ESD policy-practice gap and to propose implications in ESD practice and research.","ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION; BOUND DIFFERENCES; CONSCIOUSNESS; CHALLENGES;

The purpose of this article is to analyze the experience of the European Union (EU) regarding the use of the investment policy for sustainable development and, on this basis, to offer the provisions to be further taken into account when forming the investment policy of Ukraine to reach the Sustainable Development Goals. The authors focus on the investment policy of the EU countries, as the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Germany, Austria, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Greece. The analysis of the investment policy of these countries reveals both positive and negative aspects. The authors-researchers suggest what positive approaches of the European countries' investment policy should be considered in the laws of Ukraine. They define what investment policy of Ukraine should be like in terms of sustainable development, based on the principles of investment policy development for sustainable development proposed in the UNCTAD report, the Ukraine's national sustainable development paradigm and the EU countries' experience.",NA,"investment policy; sustainable development; EU experience; laws; perspectives","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Ustymenko, V##Zeldina, O","[Ustymenko, Volodymyr] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine.

"J","WOS:000458174300006",2019,"Beyond an absolving role for sustainable development: Assessing consumption as a basis for sustainable societies","Three decades after the launch of sustainable development as a key objective for the global community, the unsustainable exploitation of the planet's species, spaces and systems continues. This paper examines this failure by discussing the strategy of control over nature, and the idea of balance between human endeavour and nature, inherent in the term sustainable. The relevance of such ecological balance is assessed by comparing how consumption typically appears in modern human societies versus nature. This presents traits of the human actor which depart significantly from the traits of actors in typified natural settings, from which ideas of ecological balance are taken. Calling for an alternative framing of the relationship between human society and nature, possible adaptation towards a biological understanding of such a relationship is discussed through features of today's consumption, including its connection to needs, the role of labour, and the use of energy and technology.","6TH MASS EXTINCTION; SPACE; STABILITY; BIOSPHERE; FUTURE","biology; consumption; ecological balance; nature; sustainable development","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Bonnedahl, KJ##Caramujo, MJ","[Bonnedahl, Karl Johan] Umea Sch Business Econ & Stat, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.

"J","WOS:000458174300007",2019,"True sustainable development of green technology: The influencers and risked moderation of sustainable motivational behavior","To explore the essence of sustainable behaviour, a comparison was made between users' and non-users' attitudes towards bike sharing, a green technological mode of transport. The effects of three concepts on the sustainable motivational behaviour of using a bike-sharing service were studied: (i) the individual's own sustainable consciousness and self-ability (the sustainable aptitude of an object and the belief in one's skills); (ii) confidence in the service's health and environmental benefits (a positive anticipation of health and environmental benefits); and (iii) other people's sustainable norms (behaviour based on other people's sustainable attitudes). A multi-group analysis indicated significant differences in the users' and non-users' path estimates, and a risked moderator was obvious for non-users' sustainable consciousness. Other people's sustainable norms have a greater effect, particularly for users, and confidence is also a critical mediating factor for non-users of the green technology for truly sustainable development.","STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; PURCHASE INTENTION; PERCEIVED VALUE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YOUNG-ADULTS; CONSUMPTION; TRANSPORTATION; CONFIDENCE","confidence in health and environmental benefits; green technology; sustainable consciousness and self-ability; sustainable development","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Chen, SY","[Chen, Shang-Yu] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Coll Management, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","Ait Sidhoum A., 2017, SUSTAINABLE DEV##AJZEN I, 1991, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC, V50, P179, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T##Akman I, 2015, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V49, P477, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.009##ANDERSON JC, 1988, PSYCHOL BULL, V103, P411, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411##Asher H.

"J","WOS:000458174300010",2019,"Trade-offs between sustainable tourism development goals: An analysis of Tibet (China)","In the field of tourism development, decision-makers are often confronted with multiple goals regarding the tourism economy, environment and society. Taking Tibet (China) as a case study, the current paper proposes an innovative methodology for quantifying the trade-off between various tourism development goals, drawing on the Delphi method and goal programing. Our results indicate that Tibet's sustainable tourism development goals mainly consist of 10 subgoals and depend on nine decision-making variables. Depending on whether the greatest priority is given to economic, social or environmental goals, the practical implications are markedly different. We further examine changes in the subgoals and decision variables under each priority scenario. Our results allow us to recognize the key objectives involved in sustainable tourism development. This study also provides a good research framework for weighing up the priority that should be assigned to different development goals and making relevant decisions.","MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; POLICY IMPLEMENTATION; DECISION-MAKING; DESTINATION; IMPACT; GROWTH; ISLAND","goal programing; multicriteria decision-making; sustainable tourism; tourism development goals; trade-off","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Zhang, JK##Zhang, Y","[Zhang, Jiekuan; Zhang, Yan] Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Tourism, Xinyang, Peoples R China.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","Alam MS, 2016, ANN TOURISM RES, V61, P111, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2016.09.008##Amer M, 2013, FUTURES, V46, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.futures.2012.10.003##Bhuiyan MAH, 2016, SOC INDIC RES, V128, P1029, DOI 10.1007/s11205-015-1068-5##Blancas FJ, 2011, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V412, P28, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.066##Boluk K, 2017, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V25, P1201, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2017.1333263##Buckley R, 2012, ANN TOURISM RES, V39, P528, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2012.02.003##Bureau Statistics of Tibet (BST), 2001, TIB STAT YB 2001 201##Charnes A, 1955, MANAGE SCI, V1, P138, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1.2.138##Christie IT, 2008, TOURISM ECON, V14, P427, DOI 10.5367/000000008784460346##Cucculelli M, 2016, J CLEAN PROD, V111, P370, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.12.069##Day J, 2012, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V19, P379, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2012.675600##Dubois G, 2011, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V45, P1031, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2009.11.004##Ferguson L, 2011, CURR ISSUES TOUR, V14, P235, DOI 10.1080/13683500.2011.555522##Forrester J., 1973, WORLD DYNAMICS##Fu HH, 2016, ASIA PAC J TOUR RES, V21, P1343, DOI 10.1080/10941665.2016.1175487##Ghoseiri K, 2010, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V10, P1096, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2010.04.001##Gopalakrishnan H, 2015, COMPUT OPER RES, V56, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.cor.2014.11.001##Huang Y., 2015, J TOURISM HOSPITALIT, V6, P45##Jafari-Moghadam S., 2017, DECISION SCI LETT, V6, P233, DOI [10.5267/j.ds1.2016.12.006, DOI 10.5267/J.DS1.2016.12.006]##Janta H, 2012, TOURISM MANAGE, V33, P431, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2011.05.004##Jayaraman R, 2015, ENERG POLICY, V87, P447, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.027##Karou S, 2014, J TRANSP GEOGR, V35, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.01.002##Liu CH, 2012, TOURISM MANAGE, V33, P413, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2011.05.002##Liu ZhenHua, 2003, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, V11, P459, DOI 10.1080/09669580308667216##MacNeill T, 2018, TOURISM MANAGE, V66, P387, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2017.11.002##Medina-Munoz DR, 2016, SUSTAIN DEV, V24, P220, DOI 10.1002/sd.1624##National Bureau Statistics of PRC (NBSPRC) and Ministry of Environmental Protectionof PRC (MEPPRC), 2001, CHIN STAT YB ENV 200##National Tourism Administration of PRC (NTAPRC), 2001, YB CHIN TOUR STAT 20##Orchiston C, 2012, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V20, P59, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2011.617827##Reiser D, 2012, ANN LEIS RES, V15, P112, DOI 10.1080/11745398.2012.670972##Saarinen J, 2014, TOURISM GEOGR, V16, P23, DOI 10.1080/14616688.2013.851269##Saarinen J, 2011, CURR ISSUES TOUR, V14, P201, DOI 10.1080/13683500.2011.555180##Scheyvens R, 2018, TOURISM GEOGR, V20, P341, DOI 10.1080/14616688.2018.1434818##Stauvermann PJ, 2016, TOURISM MANAGE, V55, P272, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2016.02.020##Thimm T, 2017, SUSTAIN DEV, V25, P77, DOI 10.1002/sd.1643##Torres-Delgado A, 2014, ANN TOURISM RES, V49, P122, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2014.09.003##Truong VD, 2014, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V22, P1071, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2013.871019##UN, 2015, TRANSFORMING OUR WOR##UN (United Nations), 2000, MILL DEV GOALS REP, P2015##UNWTO, 2015, TOUR SUST DEV GOALS##UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organisation), 1998, GUID LOC AUTH DEV SU##Wang D, 2013, TOURISM MANAGE, V36, P221, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2012.11.021##Wang Y, 2017, IEEE T SUSTAIN ENERG, V8, P530, DOI 10.1109/TSTE.2016.2608841##Wang ZJ, 2015, EUR J OPER RES, V242, P890, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2014.10.025##World Commission on the Environment and Development, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##Xu FF, 2014, J CHINA TOUR RES, V10, P121, DOI 10.1080/19388160.2013.849641##Yang L, 2011, ANN TOURISM RES, V38, P561, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2010.10.009##Yeh ET, 2007, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V97, P593, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00565.x##Yfantidou G, 2017, SUSTAIN DEV, V25, P459, DOI 10.1002/sd.1655##Zhang A.L., 2013, J TIBET U, P18##Zhang JK, 2016, J CLEAN PROD, V127, P262, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.131##Zhang JK, 2015, ECOL INDIC, V56, P218, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.04.006##Zhang K., 2006, ENV PROT, V42, P25",5,"2021-09-03","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71764027]; Nanhu Scholars Program for Young Scholars of Xinyang Normal University","COM13","no","SDG.8#SDG.9"

This study analyzes the relationship between the utilization of natural capital and economic development in the countries along China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative using a panel regression model. The results show that the labor force, rural and urban populations, and exports and imports have a significant impact on both natural capital consumption and economic development. However, the impact of exports and imports on economic development here is contrary to economic theory and experience. We also find that there is still resource dependence in economic development and that natural capital consumption has a long-run impact on it. To address this, the ""Belt and Road"" countries should adopt comprehensive national and regional measures to build a mutually beneficial cooperative mechanism and trade environment.","ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; UNIT-ROOT TESTS; LAND-USE; ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COINTEGRATION; HEALTH; ENERGY; WATER","economic development; Granger causality; natural capital utilization; panel regression model; sustainable development; the Belt and Road Initiative","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Hou, XH##Liu, JM##Zhang, DJ","[Hou, Xianhui; Zhang, Daojun] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

The authors made an attempt at designing a synthetic measure thanks to which changes in sixteen regions of Poland between 2003 and 2013 are presented with respect to the level of sustainability based on three components: social, economic, and environmental order. This enabled an analysis of the structure of sustainable development using the shift-share method. The force of impact of the internal structure was defined, along with external determinants of individual regions, which have influenced the level of sustainable development. The performed analysis showed that the indicators of sustainable development, both for individual regions and for the whole of Poland, had not changed significantly in the determined two moments of time (2003 and 2013). However, the increase in indicators for individual regions is greatly diversified, and in the majority of provinces has a negative character with a slight value. In several regions, positive values can be noticed, whereas the increase in their values is high. This diversity testifies to the uneven development of Polish regions.","INDICATORS; GROWTH; EU","sustainable development; integrated order; indicators of sustainable development; synthetic measure; shift-share analysis; Poland's regions","POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","Cieslak, I##Pawlewicz, K##Pawlewicz, A","[Cieslak, Iwona] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Inst Geoinformat & Cartog, Olsztyn, Poland.

"J","WOS:000459358300119",2019,"Integration of energy, water and environmental systems for a sustainable development","Joint efforts and interdisciplinary approach are proper means to face the issue of global warming. An adequate response should be to employ state of the art scientific knowledge for the technology advancement, as well as for fostering new scientific insights. Together with resource efficiency, circular economy is getting in focus of researchers and consequently policymakers. Sustainable development is a multidisciplinary topic and interaction of energy, water and environment systems plays one of the central roles. Within the paradigm of circular economy, there is growing need for system integration where a by-product of one system can represent resource for the other. This review is dedicated to the 12th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Sysmems, and discusses some latest developments in three main areas of sustainability themes: (i) Energy, (ii) Water and (iii) Environmental Systems. Examples of circular economy approach have been emphasized which improve economic efficiency of the whole chain and further decrease environmental burden, enabling cleaner production. Although integrative concept of energy, water and environmental systems is coming in the research focus, more effort is necessary for further integration of those systems, whereby increased complexity is going to be handled only by multidisciplinary, intersectoral scientific cooperation.

"J","WOS:000459477100001",2019,"Sustainable development concept in the chemistry curriculum An exploration of foundation students' perspective","Purpose This paper aims to investigate the knowledge, attitude and behaviour of foundation chemistry learners concerning the sustainable development concept. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted. Atlas.ti software was used to analyse the chemistry curriculum based on selected themes and sub-themes. A survey was carried out involving 132 chemistry learners. The chemistry learners were students from a foundation programme in a local university located in Selangor, Malaysia. The collected data were analysed using SPSS 21.0 involving descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings Document analysis on the chemistry curriculum shows that water is the theme most covered in the chemistry learners' textbook, as compared to other themes. In general, the chemistry learners have good knowledge and attitude concerning the sustainable development concept. However, their knowledge and attitude do not reflect in their behaviour as an individual, as well as in the classroom. Moreover, their knowledge, attitude and behaviour focus more on environmental dimension, as compared to other sustainable development dimensions. Practical implications This paper is instrumental in assisting educators to assess how chemistry learners perceive sustainable development, and this may help to bring about changes to improve chemistry teaching and learning processes towards education for sustainable development. Originality/value This paper is an original and novel research paper which is first conducted on sustainable development concept in chemistry curriculum in Malaysia.","HIGHER-EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; SCIENCE","Knowledge; Attitude; Teaching; Sustainable development; Behaviour; Chemistry; Learning","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Kanapathy, S##Lee, KE##Sivapalan, S##Mokhtar, M##Zakaria, SZS##Mohd Zahidi, A","[Kanapathy, Suganty; Lee, Khai Ern; Mokhtar, Mazlin; Zakaria, Sharifah Zarina Syed] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev LESTARI, Bangi, Malaysia.

In order to achieve these goals within the coming years, intense efforts are required by all political and societal actors. Although the first definitions of sustainable development referred to the forest sector, the question remains: what contribution can forestry make to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals? Therefore, the direct positive and negative effects of forestry itself on sustainability are analyzed, and it is discussed how sustainable forest management could contribute to achieving other Sustainable Development Goals in addition to SDG 15. This analysis reveals that forestry plays a dual role, i.e., forestry can achieve positive sustainability effects but can also have negative impacts. It is thus recommended to use integrated assessment approaches to analyze whether a specific forest-related policy or strategy is contributing to sustainable development. Beside quantitative integrated assessments, the use of qualitative frameworks like the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development is proposed. It is also suggested to operationalize the concept of second-order sustainability performance for the forest sector in future research.","MANAGEMENT; CERTIFICATION; INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK","forestry; sustainable forest management; Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD); second-order sustainability performance; physicity","FORESTS","Baumgartner, RJ","[Baumgartner, Rupert J.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Univ Pl 3, A-8010 Graz, Austria.","Forestry","Forestry","[Anonymous], 2014, OECD ENV PERF REV CO##Baumgartner RJ, 2017, J CLEAN PROD, V140, P81, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.146##Baumgartner RJ, 2010, SUSTAIN DEV, V18, P76, DOI 10.1002/sd.447##Bratt C, 2011, J CLEAN PROD, V19, P1631, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.05.012##Broman GI, 2017, J CLEAN PROD, V140, P17, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.121##Carlsson L, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/su9061061##Celine E, 2013, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL, V19, P1173, DOI 10.1111/gcb.12092##Danielsen F, 2009, CONSERV BIOL, V23, P348, DOI 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01096.x##Department of Economic and Social Affairs Statistics Division United Nations, 2002, INT STAND IND CLASS##Ekener E, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V181, P337, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.211##Englisch M., 2009, BFW PRAXISINFORMATIO, V18, P13##Fern, 2016, ACH SUST DEV GOALS F##Ferraro PJ, 2002, ECOL ECON, V43, P261, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00219-7##Gratzer G, 2018, KIOES OPIN, V8, P13##Gregersen H, 2017, INT FOREST REV, V19, P10##Gunther E., 2008, OKOLOGIEORIENTIERTES##Holmberg J, 2000, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V7, P291, DOI 10.1080/13504500009470049##International Organisation for Standardisation, 2010, 26000 ISO##ISO 14044, 2006, 14044 ISO##ISSC, 2015, REV SUST DEV GOALS S##Kloepffer W, 2008, INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS, V13, P89, DOI 10.1065/lca2008.02.376##Le Blanc D, 2015, SUSTAIN DEV, V23, P176, DOI 10.1002/sd.1582##Lebedys A., 2004, FSFMACC07 FOR PROD E##Mendoza GA, 2003, FOREST ECOL MANAG, V174, P329, DOI 10.1016/S0378-1127(02)00044-0##Missimer M, 2017, J CLEAN PROD, V140, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.059##Mohr J., TOOLKIT MAPPING RELA##Ny Henrik, 2009, Progress in Industrial Ecology, V6, P216, DOI 10.1504/PIE.2009.031063##Obersteiner M, 2016, SCI ADV, V2, DOI 10.1126/sciadv.1501499##Pradhan P, 2017, EARTHS FUTURE, V5, P1169, DOI 10.1002/2017EF000632##Robert K.H., 2000, J CLEAN PROD, V8, P243, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0959-6526(00)00011-1##Robert KH, 2013, ECOL SOC, V18, DOI 10.5751/ES-05336-180205##Robert KH, 2002, J CLEAN PROD, V10, P197, DOI 10.1016/S0959-6526(01)00061-0##Santopuoli G, 2016, J ENVIRON POL PLAN, V18, P177, DOI 10.1080/1523908X.2015.1065718##Seymour F., 2016, WHY FORESTS WHY NOW##Spangenberg JH, 2017, SUSTAIN DEV, V25, P311, DOI 10.1002/sd.1657##The Montreal Process Working Group, 2015, MONTR PROC CRIT IND##Timko J, 2018, CURR OPIN ENV SUST, V34, P7, DOI 10.1016/j.cosust.2018.06.004##Troster R, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V196, P1034, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.240##Tuppura A, 2016, BUS STRATEG ENVIRON, V25, P355, DOI 10.1002/bse.1878##United Nations, ENVDEV1683PI2176 UN##United Nations Division for Sustainable Development Department of Policy Co ordination and Sustainable Development (UNDPCSD), 1996, IND SUST DEV FRAM ME##United Nations General Assembly, 2014, ROAD DIGN 2030 END P##van der Ven H, 2018, CURR OPIN ENV SUST, V32, P104, DOI 10.1016/j.cosust.2018.06.001##van Noordwijk M, 2018, CURR OPIN ENV SUST, V34, P33, DOI 10.1016/j.cosust.2018.09.003##Vierikko K, 2008, SCAND J FOREST RES, V23, P431, DOI 10.1080/02827580802284693##von Carlowitz H.

In order to optimise this, this study evaluated and reconceptualised a sustainable development assessment tool for health and care settings in England. Methods: A quantitative survey and user/expert discussion panels were conducted to evaluate and reconceptualise the existing sustainable development assessment tool used by the NHS in England, the so-called 'Good Corporate Citizenship Assessment Tool', including potential improvements such as the integration of the UN's SDGs. Results: A reconceptualised self-assessment tool integrating the UN's SDGs was developed and implemented online as the 'Sustainable Development Assessment Tool' (SDAT). Further improvements included a process-oriented redesign and the creation of new modules and cross-sections aligning them with the leads responsible for the implementation of key initiatives in NHS organisations, which would contribute to achieving the targets of the SDGs. Conclusion: User/expert involvement has enabled an informed approach to a reconceptualisation of a sustainable assessment tool for health and care settings. The tool will support organisations to build their mandatory Sustainable Development Management Plans, as part of the National Public Health Outcomes Framework. Alignment of the tool to the UN's SDGs provides an opportunity for health and care organisations to demonstrate accountability and progress against the UN's set of transformational goals. Furthermore, the tool could be adapted to other public service providers.","SELF-ASSESSMENT","sustainable development; tool; self-assessment; health and care; UN Sustainable Development Goals; SDGs; NHS","PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH","Hewitt, M##Molthan-Hill, P##Lomax, R##Baddley, J","[Hewitt, Michael; Molthan-Hill, Petra] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England.

"J","WOS:000467440700003",2019,"Bioenergy technology development in Nigeria - pathway to sustainable energy development","In Nigeria, high and outrageous energy cost constitutes a serious challenge to all aspects of the economy. And this has been a subject of concern in the country over a period of time. A dependable and renewable energy source is of utmost desire to strengthen the nation's economy and this urgent need cannot be overlooked. As a result of the erratic and expensive power supply to the national grid, it has become ultimately necessary to search for other inexpensive sources of energy to meet the ever increasing energy needs for rural and urban dwellers. In view of the above energy situation in Nigeria, this paper aimed at carrying out a comprehensive review on bioenergy technology option as a pathway to achieving sustainable energy development in the country. The potential, current progressive stages, and prospects of bioenergy conversion techniques, in the Nigeria context, are discussed. The barriers to bioenergy technology development in Nigeria with possible solutions are also presented.","BIOMASS; GENERATION; WASTE; RESOURCES; EMISSIONS; BIOFUELS","bioenergy technology; BET; renewable energy; energy sector; sustainable development","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Oyedepo, SO##Dunmade, IS##Adekeye, T##Attabo, AA##Olawole, OC##Babalola, PO##Oyebanji, JA##Udo, MO##Kilanko, O##Leramo, RO","[Oyedepo, Sunday O.; Adekeye, Tunde; Attabo, Ahme A.; Babalola, Philip O.; Udo, Mfon O.; Kilanko, Oluwaseun; Leramo, Richard O.] Covenant Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.

In Turkey, environmental problems were first discussed within the framework of the 3rd Five-Year Plan (1973-1977). However, actual studies on environment and sustainable development began in the 2000s. The primary aim of this paper is to present sustainable development activities and policies in Turkey to determine the progress in this regard. Moreover, the effect and the role of education in sustainable development will be investigated. The main argument of the paper is that educational activities on environment are not designed to accommodate sustainable development. In this manner, this paper will offer new suggestions about the adaptation of environmental literacy to the education system and turning people's interest in attitudes towards the environment into behavioural patterns so as to establish sustainable development.","TEACHERS","sustainable development; education policy; environment policy; public policy","AGATHOS-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES","Tahtalioglu, H##Kulac, O","[Tahtalioglu, Hava] Nigde Omer Halisdemir Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Nigde, Turkey.

Everything happens at a faster pace, from the way production and consumption takes place to the way the environment is degrading. Henceforth, sustainable development appeared in response to these consequences. However, considering that we are discussing the topic of sustainable development for over three decades now, it is probably time to bring it forward in another way and try to better understand it through opposing perspectives. Therefore, the present paper explores differing views on the discussed topic, and analyses sustainable development in relation to other similar terms, trying to provide a clear meaning of the concept. More, it looks to provide a own interpretation of sustainable development, and intends to bring forward some of the most popular and disputing models surrounding it.","FRAMEWORK","Sustainable Development; Sustainability; Theoretical Framework","STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS","Panta, ND","[Panta, Nancy Diana] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.","Economics","Business & Economics","Gomis AJB, 2011, BUS SOC REV, V116, P171, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8594.2011.00381.x##Barbosa G., 2014, INT J SOCIAL SCI, V3##Barter N., 2012, P 11 AUSTR C SOC ENV, P1##Beck U., 2004, CONVERSATIONS ULRICH##Blewitt J, 2008, UNDERSTANDING SUSTAI##BROWN LR, 1981, BUILDING SUSTAINABLE##Cahill M., 2001, SOCIAL POLICY ENV##Dempsey N, 2011, SUSTAIN DEV, V19, P289, DOI 10.1002/sd.417##Dernbach John C., 1998, CASE W RES L REV, V49, P1##Dobson A., 1996, ENVIRON POLIT, V5, P401, DOI DOI 10.1080/09644019608414280##Duran DC, 2015, PROC ECON FINANC, V26, P806, DOI 10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00849-7##Duran DC, 2015, PROC ECON FINANC, V26, P812, DOI 10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00852-7##Ekins P, 2003, ECOL ECON, V44, P165, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00272-0##ELKINGTON J, 1994, CALIF MANAGE REV, V36, P90, DOI 10.2307/41165746##EMAS R, 2015, BRIEF GSDR, V2015, P1, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.MARPOL.2014.01.019##Feil Alexandre Andr, 2017, Cad.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals will serve as the theoretical framework of this analysis. Germany currently accounts a share of 16 % of the terrestrial land area under strict nature protection. This means that there is no quantity problem. Rather, the question arises about the number, geographical distribution and quality of protected areas - in this example Biosphere Reserves. So far, scientific papers only focus on the natural landscape representativeness of Biosphere Reserves in Germany. This is not enough for this category of protected areas as it rests on the paradigm of sustainable development. This is why this paper is focusing on possible structural and socioeconomic shortcomings in the network of German Biosphere Reserves.

It adopts multiple data collection methods including non-participant observations made during visits to five sustainable enterprises, and references internal and published documents among other information about the case enterprises, including annual reports, previous studies about the companies and news reports. In-depth interview sessions were held with top management team members and employees, including CEOs or MDs, and division/functional heads. The grounded theory is adopted as an approach to analyze the data. The analysis reveals six emerging organizational culture development practices: identifying virtues, social and environmental responsibility and innovation as core values; leaders acting as models according to these values; growing their own managers to continue their corporate cultures; designing communication channels to emphasize the core values among employees; using the core values as criteria to recruit new employees; avoiding employee layoff to preserve the core values even in times of financial crisis. Limitations and future research directions to develop a behavioral theory of sustainability culture in organizational settings, as well as managerial implications are discussed.","STAKEHOLDER THEORY; LEADERSHIP; ETHICS","corporate sustainability; sustainability culture; sufficiency economy; culture development; Thailand","SUSTAINABILITY","Ketprapakorn, N##Kantabutra, S","[Ketprapakorn, Nuttasorn] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Business, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.

The paper provides a literature review on both of the two concepts and their histories. The two are then related to each other in order to explore the interrelation and integration between the two concepts. It is determined that achieving SD requires Good governance, and achieving Good Governance requires SD. This is studied using Heliopolis University for Sustainable Development as a case study in which a sample of 100 (n = 100) from both administrative and academic staff members, responded to a questionnaire on the topics of SD and Good Governance. The results showed a strong relationship between the various concepts and variables of Good Governance measured and between the applications of SD concepts. The significance of the study is that, while there is a significant research and study on the topics of SD and Good Governance, little focus has been placed on the intersection between these two critical fields. Furthermore, this study provides empirical evidence for the connect as well as the implications Good Governance has on the success of the institutionalization of SD.","INDICATORS","Sustainable Development; Good Governance; Corporate Governance; Millennium Development Goals MDGs","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Ramzy, O##El Bedawy, R##Anwar, M##Eldahan, OH","[Ramzy, Omar; Anwar, Mohamed; Eldahan, Omar H.] Heliopolis Univ Sustainable Dev, Fac Business & Econ, Cairo, Egypt.

Goal 4 promotes quality education and Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However, creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require individuals to acquire key competencies', aligning with notions of transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context specific competencies.","PROGRAM","education for sustainable development; key competencies; sustainable development goals; SDG 4; transformative learning; evaluation framework","SUSTAINABILITY","Giangrande, N##White, RM##East, M##Jackson, R##Clarke, T##Coste, MS##Penha-Lopes, G","[Giangrande, Naresh; Jackson, Ross] Gaia Educ, Edinburgh EH9 1PL, Midlothian, Scotland.

Which elements can be identified to support socially sustainable innovation processes in urban development and how were the elements realized in urban innovation processes in Finland in 2013 and 2015 are the research questions. According to the literature review, socially sustainable innovation processes include an open and interactive development approach, resident and user-driven involvement, communication, learning and feedback, and impact assessment. To track the elements in practice a qualitative approach using case-based research was conducted. The results reveal that urban development processes in Finland could not be considered socially sustainable because the elements are realized differently.

"J","WOS:000472585500011",2019,"Translation of Earth observation data into sustainable development indicators: An analytical framework","In 2015, member countries of the United Nations adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals at the Sustainable Development Summit in New York. These global goals have 169 targets and 232 indicators that are based on the three pillars of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental. Substantial challenges remain in obtaining data of the required quality, especially in developing countries, given the often limited resources available. One promising and innovative way of addressing this issue of data availability is to use Earth observation (EO). This paper presents the results of research to develop a novel analytical framework for assessing the potential of EO approaches to populate the SDG indicators. We present a Maturity Matrix Framework and apply it to all of the 232 SDG indicators. The results demonstrate that although the applicability of EO-derived data do vary between the Sustainable Development Goal indicators, overall, EO has an important contribution to make towards populating a wide diversity of the Sustainable Development Goals indicators.","NIGHTTIME LIGHT DATA; SATELLITE IMAGERY; DYNAMICS; DMSP/OLS; ECONOMY; SCALES; CHINA; YIELD; PROXY","Earth observation (EO); indicators; socio-economic; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Andries, A##Morse, S##Murphy, R##Lynch, J##Woolliams, E##Fonweban, J","[Andries, Ana; Morse, Stephen; Murphy, Richard; Lynch, Jim] Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Arthur C Clarke Bldg,Floor 2, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.

The present paper is an attempt to analyze the cause of consumerism and recommend an eco-spiritual policy perspective for ensuring sustainable development. The paper analyzes that the United Nations recently announced Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot lead the economies towards sustainable development. Ensuring sustainable development will require curbing consumerism consciously through exploring the unexplored spiritual dimension, which can inspire humanity to lead a life of simplicity, moderation, and minimum desires for sustainable and all-inclusive development. It has been stressed that aspiration of breakthrough result requires moving away from the external to the inward synthesis of the spiritual aspects, which believes in co-existence, acknowledging care, and concern for both human beings and the nature. The paper argues for an eco-spiritual perspective for furthering the goal of sustainability.","ECONOMIC-GROWTH; KUZNETS CURVE; CONSUMPTION","consumerism; ecological footprint; eco-spiritual; human development index; policy perspective; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Jain, P##Jain, P","[Jain, Prerna] Jaipuria Inst Management, Dept Econ, 1 Bambala Inst Area, Jaipur 302033, Rajasthan, India.

Well-being of hosts, in accordance with UNWTO or UNGA, should be achieved when sustainable tourism guidelines are fulfilled. The question posed in this article, however, challenges that view. Does it really lead to well-being? Or maybe we are missing some important issues on the way? The article is divided into three sections. In the first section, well-being conceptual backgrounds are presented. The second section is devoted to the analysis of well-being usage in sustainable tourism conceptual background, and focuses on the differences between the guidelines provided in 2005, and the latest guidelines published by UNWTO and UNGA in 2015. The third part, juxtaposes well-being conceptual background with tourism. Eventually, most prominent gaps and challenges of well-being in a frame of sustainable tourism are presented in detail.","RESIDENTS ATTITUDES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; SOCIAL IMPACTS; PERCEPTIONS; INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK; HAPPINESS; SUPPORT; INDEX","human well-being; sustainable development; tourism","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Dluzewska, AM","[Dluzewska, Anna Maria] Kazimierz Wielki Univ Bydgoszcz, Dept Hlth Phys Culture & Tourism, Bydgoszcz, Poland.

"J","WOS:000472684600011",2019,"Sustainable Development - Utopia or Implementation Possibilities?","The paper contains deliberations concerning the concept of sustainable development and utopia. The concept of utopia explains different perceptions of utopia, also from the historical point of view. Utopia usually brings negative associations because in the past it comprised unreal ideas presented in a simplified way and unattainable. Currently, the concept of utopia is presented as the necessity to introduce changes which have to be supported with action and cannot only be treated as dreams. You should be aware of opportunities and impossibilities of changing the reality when you do not agree with its functioning. The second subchapter attempts to answer the question whether the sustainable development idea is a new utopia. The authors of the sustainable development idea do not present the vision of a better world which would replace the reality. They look for mechanisms which would allow their gradual implementation because it is not about a perfect world but about creating a holistic reality model. Therefore, the sustainable development idea means rather a plan of changes and not utopia. The presented plans include the Earth Summit Resolutions and 27 rules of the Rio Declaration (1992). Their content is presented in the third subchapter of the article. Implementation of those resolutions and rules was assessed critically because it is suspected that they constitute a cover for the elites who desire power and that this is utopia used as a social manipulation tool. Therefore, the sustainable development idea is supposed to be a model of reality, an announcement of performance of that model, or at least an attempt to take actions in order to achieve the planned development.",NA,"sustainable development; utopia; Earth Summit","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Bukrejewski, P##Latawiec, A##Matuszewska, A","[Bukrejewski, Pawet] Przemyslowy Inst Motoryzacji, Ul Jagiellonska 55, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.

Additionally, the sustainable development concept is based on three main and overlapping pillars (social, economic and environmental). Maintaining balance between them is only way to achieve at least acceptable effects of sustainable development. Analyses in this field have focused on identification of boosters and inhibitors of sustainable development. Taking into consideration this context in our paper, the analyses were devoted to identifying whether a smaller gender gap level (e.g. incentives, political engagement, and education) aligns with higher results in obtaining sustainable development goals. Three hypotheses were formulated that state that mitigating the gender gap supports the social, economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development. Indeed, the results of our study show that in particular, a smaller gender gap related to educational attainment and political empowerment of females is connected positively with higher levels of sustainable development of the three pillars in specific countries. The final conclusion is that diminishment of inequality between females and males supports harmonious and sustainable development of societies in social, economic and environmental dimensions.","LEADERSHIP-STYLES","sustainable development; pillars of sustainable development; gender gap","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Domanska, A##Zukowska, B##Zajkowski, R","[Domanska, Ada; Zukowska, Beata; Zajkowski, Robert] Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Maria Curie Sklodowska Sq 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ANNAN K., 2008, QUOTES HUMAN RIGHTS##[Anonymous], 2018, GLOBAL GENDER GAP RE##[Anonymous], 2008, GEND SUST DEV MAX EC##[Anonymous], 2018, IMPLEMENTING GOALS G##[Anonymous], 2017, WOM PARL 2017 YEAR R##[Anonymous], 2009, GREEN JOBS WOM WORK##[Anonymous], 2018, 2030 AGENDA SUSTAINA##Arbia G., 2014, PRIMER SPATIAL ECONO##Banerjee S, 2004, HIERARCHICAL MODELIN##BENAVOT A, 1989, SOCIOL EDUC, V62, P14, DOI 10.2307/2112821##BOOTH C., 2001, SEEKING TRUE DEMOCRA##BOULANGER P.

The Agenda influences tourism policy even though the Agenda resolution only mentions tourism three times. A heterogeneous constructionism approach is adopted to examine the managerial ecology of tourism and the SDGs. Managerial ecology involves the instrumental application of science and economic utilitarian approaches and in the service of resource utilisation and economic development. A managerial ecological approach is integral to UNWTO work on the SDGs, as well as other actors, and is reflected in policy recommendations for achievement of the SDGs even though tourism is less sustainable than ever with respect to resource use. This situation substantially affects capacities to do other, and create alternative development and policy trajectories. It is concluded that a more reflexive understanding of knowledge and management is required to better understand the implications of knowledge circulation and legitimisation and action for sustainable tourism. More fundamentally, there is a need to rethink human-environment relations given the mistaken belief that the exertion of more effort and greater efficiency will alone solve problems of sustainable tourism.","MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; ECONOMY; POLICY; CARBON; FISH","Complexity; heterogeneous constructionism; knowledge; managerial ecology; neoliberalism; sustainable development goals","JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM","Hall, CM","[Hall, C.

The assumption is based, however, on an insufficiently critical understanding of the historical role of education in supporting unsustainable development. The article provides a critical account of the relationship between education policy and sustainable development in Africa as an aspect of the postcolonial condition, i.e. as an aspect of the colonial legacy and of Africa's position in relation to contemporary processes of globalisation. It is argued that if education is to play a transformative role in relation to sustainable development then education policy needs to be fundamentally re-oriented and harnessed to wider processes of economic, cultural and political transformation in the interests of social and environmental justice.","POLITICAL-ECONOMY; SKILLS; POLICY","Sustainable development; Education for sustainable development; Africa; Postcolonial condition","ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW","Tikly, L","[Tikly, Leon] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.

Over the past several decades, policymakers and business practitioners increasingly acknowledge that the long-term development and sustainability of tourism destinations require clear guidelines and direction. The impetus for sustainable tourism development has become ever more urgent as a result of dual trends of climate change and massification of the global tourism industry. The current research review used science mapping techniques to examine 1596 Scopus-indexed documents published on sustainable tourism development. The objectives of the review were to document the size, growth, and global distribution of this literature, identify its key journals, authors, and documents, highlight emerging topics, and illuminate the underlying intellectual structure of this literature. The review also provides guidelines for scholars to develop research that can aid in future sustainable tourism development.","MIXED METHODS; MANAGEMENT; ECOTOURISM; ATTITUDES; ISSUES; CONSERVATION; HOSPITALITY; DESTINATION; INDICATORS; AUSTRALIA","sustainable tourism development; tourism sustainability; tourism development; science mapping; bibliometric review; systematic review of research","SUSTAINABILITY","Yoopetch, C##Nimsai, S","[Yoopetch, Chanin; Nimsai, Suthep] Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, Ctr Res Sustainable Dev, 69 Vipavadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Akinboade OA, 2010, INT J TOUR RES, V12, P149, DOI 10.1002/jtr.743##Albrecht JN, 2014, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V22, P1052, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2013.847945##ALVAREZGARCIA J, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI DOI 10.3390/su10041158##Ballantyne R, 2009, ANN TOURISM RES, V36, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2008.07.001##Baloglu S., 1999, J HOSP TOUR MANAG, V23, P53, DOI DOI 10.1177/109634809902300105##Benckendorff P, 2013, ANN TOURISM RES, V43, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2013.04.005##Boyack KW, 2009, SCIENTOMETRICS, V79, P45, DOI 10.1007/s11192-009-0403-5##Bramwell B., 2013, TOURISM GOVERNANCE, P59##Bramwell B, 2013, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V21, P1, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2012.741602##Briassoulis H, 2002, ANN TOURISM RES, V29, P1065, DOI 10.1016/S0160-7383(02)00021-X##BRUNDTLAND GH, 1987, ENVIRON CONSERV, V14, P291, DOI 10.1017/S0376892900016805##Buckley R, 2012, ANN TOURISM RES, V39, P528, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2012.02.003##Butler R.

"J","WOS:000477051900218",2019,"Sustainable Development of Coastal Food Services","Coastal food services are an important segment within sea and sun' tourism. They have a direct impact on the environment from liquid and solid waste generation, air contamination, and excessive energy and water consumption. Mass tourism and the contemporary threat of climate change enhance the anthropogenic intrusion, especially in vulnerable coastal zones. To prevent overexploitation of the coastal zones, the adaptation of the sustainable principles by coastal stakeholders is an urgent matter. Thus, this study aims to design a model of sustainable development for restaurants and to examine the level of its adoption by seaside restaurant owners in two touristic beach areas of Cadiz province, Spain. A questionnaire was performed during the high summer season in 2018. The obtained data was analysed by IBM SPSS software. The survey results showed that the model of sustainable development has been poorly adopted by restaurant managers. Foreign managers of international restaurants are less involved in the adoption of the sustainable model in comparison to Spanish restaurant owners. Moreover, restaurants that have been opened more than 10-20 years provide a more sustainable way of business operation in comparison with newly established food service organizations.","LOCAL FOOD; MANAGEMENT; GREEN; INNOVATION; TOURISM; RESTAURANTS; PERCEPTIONS; CONSUMPTION; DIFFUSION; PRESSURE","model of sustainable development; green practices; coastal restaurants","SUSTAINABILITY","Iamkovaia, M##Arcila, M##Martins, FC##Izquierdo, A","[Iamkovaia, Mariia] Univ Cadiz, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Cadiz 11003, Spain.

"J","WOS:000478391400001",2021,"Segmented prizing: biopolitical differentiation in education for sustainable development","Prizes and awards have received limited attention in scholarly research. The present paper engages with the prestigious UNESCO-Japan Prize on Education for Sustainable Development, which annually honours three outstanding projects related to education for sustainable development (ESD). Drawing on biopolitical theory, the paper explores what this prize can tell us about the global community's quest for sustainable development. While the award is global in scope and alludes to humanity's joint responsibility for the planet, the analysis shows that the winning organisations approach rich and poor populations around the world in entirely different ways; assigning to them different roles, responsibilities and lifestyles. ESD discourse thus displays a remarkable ability to accommodate the lifestyle divide that separates rich and poor; suggesting that inequality has become effectively normalised. Ultimately it is argued that differentiating practices in the global implementation of ESD constitutes an urgent area of further research for comparative and international education.","NEOLIBERAL BIOPOLITICS; POLITICS; WATER; LIFE","Biopolitics; differentiation; education for sustainable development; inequality; lifestyle; prize","COMPARE-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION","Knutsson, B","[Knutsson, Beniamin] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Pedag Curricular & Profess Studies, POB 300, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.

It starts by presenting the emergence, efficacy, and eminence of the concept and term ""sustainable development"" (which is integral to ESD) in terms of its historical definition, dimensions, understanding, interpretations, and challenges. It also highlights the take-up of sustainable development in terms of green growth, human development, and human agency. It then presents an overview of ESD, accompanied by a discussion of its key characteristics, approaches, and significances. The paper then highlights a semantic analysis of the development of ESD, with a special focus on some converging processes, events, concepts, discourses, and declarations that have supported the rise of ESD and shaped its status to date. Considerable emphasis is placed on the significance and nexus between environmental education and ESD. The paper analyses the crucial interconnection between education, sustainable development, ESD, the SDGs, and human development. Furthermore, the paper discusses the centrality of ESD to the global education discourse and the nexus, role, and relevance of education and particularly ESD in relation to the achievement of all the SDGs. The paper concludes by critically reflecting on the above, vis-a-vis the author's previous empirical research on higher ESD, making recommendations on the future of ESD research and practice.","SOUTHERN AFRICA","2030 Education Agenda; education; Education for Sustainable Development (ESD); policy and practice; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); sustainable development","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Agbedahin, AV","[Agbedahin, Adesuwa Vanessa] Univ Free State, SARCHi Chair Higher Educ & Human Dev Res Grp, Room 206,Benito Khotseng Bldg,Senate St North, Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","Bhaskar R., 1998, POSSIBILITY NATURALI##Bhaskar R, 1989, POSSIBILITY NATURALI##Bhaskar R., 1979, POSSIBILITY NATURALI##Bowen A., 2012, GREEN GROWTH WHAT DO##Carson R, 1994, SILENT SPRING##Carson R, 1962, SILENT SPRING##Carson R., 2002, SILENT SPRING##Chrystalbridge M., 2002, ED SUSTAINABLE DEV T##Cutter A., 2015, SUSTAINABLE DEV GOAL##Daviet B., 2016, ED RES FORESIGHT WOR##Fincham R., 2004, SUSTAINABLE DEV U NE##Future Earth, 2018, SEEDB TRANSF C S AFR##Global RCE Network, 2017, RCE VIS MISS##Guo LL, 2018, SUSTAIN DEV, V26, P302, DOI 10.1002/sd.1716##Hattingh J., 2002, ENV ED ETHICS ACTION, P5##Hopkins C., 2001, FORUM APPL RES PUBLI, V93, P25##IPCC, 2014, CLIMATE CHANGE 2014, DOI [10.1017/CBO9781107415416, 10.1017/CBO9781107415324, DOI 10.1017/CBO9781107415324]##IUCN /UNEP /WWF, 1980, WORLD CONS STRAT LIV##Jickling B., 1992, J ENVIRON EDUC, V23, P5, DOI DOI 10.1080/00958964.1992.9942801##Knapp D., 2000, J ENVIRON EDUC, V31, P32, DOI [10.1080/00958960009598643, DOI 10.1080/00958960009598643]##Lotz-Sisitka H., 2018, TENSIONS CONTRADICTI##Lotz-Sisitka H., 2007, SO AFRICAN J ENV ED, V24, P8##Lotz-Sisitka H., 2015, MAINSTREAMING ENV SU##LOTZSISITKA H, 2011, HIGHER ED WORLD 4 HI, V4, P41##Lupele J., 2012, LEARNING TODAY TOMOR##Mandikonza C, 2016, EDUC RES SOC CHANG, V5, P107, DOI 10.17159/2221-4070/2016/v5i1a7##Manoj PDS, 2015, IEEE T COMPUT, V64, P3022, DOI 10.1109/TC.2015.2389827##McKeown R., 2003, ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCAT, V9, P117, DOI DOI 10.1080/13504620303469##McKeown R., 2002, APPL ENV ED COMMUNIC, V1, P21##MEADOWS D H, 1972, P205##Nhamo G., 2016, SUSTAINABILITY CLIMA##O'Donoghue RB, 1993, SO AFRICAN J ENV ED, V13, P28##O'Donoghue R, 2006, AUST J ENVIRON EDUC, V22, P105, DOI 10.1017/S0814062600001737##Open Working Group, 2014, OP WORK GROUP PROP S##Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development, 2011, GREEN GROWTH##Pavlova M., 2011, ENV ED ED SUSTAINABL##Poeck K.

From planning, economic, and political angles, the feasibility and limitations of heritage building conservation in relation to conservation and sustainable development are presented. Compared to ecological conservation, built heritage conservation can easily accommodate sustainable development, as it is certainly a physical dimension for managing cultural heritage conservation. Built heritage as heritage buildings can articulate with real estate development via proper conservation planning. Its historical aspect signifies the legitimacy of conservation, while its proprietary aspect renders it fit for betterment.","MODEL","built heritage; heritage building; sustainable development; transaction cost; Veblen good; experience good","SUSTAINABILITY","Lai, LWC##Davies, SNG##Lorne, FT","[Lai, Lawrence W.

"J","WOS:000482330500002",2019,"Renewable energy, non-renewable energy and sustainable development","The purpose of the present study is to analyse the effects of renewable energy and non-renewable energy on sustainable development. This study is pioneering in this respect because it analyses the effect of renewable energy on adjusted net savings, which is a good sustainable development variable. For this purpose, the data of 40 developed and 73 developing countries were included. According to the estimation results obtained in the study, renewable energy has a positive and statistically significant effect on sustainable development both in developed countries and in developing countries. The impact of renewable energy on sustainable development is greater than the impact of non-renewable energy. In this respect, as the renewable energy amount increases, the level of sustainable development increases. According to these results, the fact that countries use renewable energy more than non-renewable energy sources is extremely important in terms of making progress towards sustainability of development and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.","ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; CONSUMPTION; EMISSIONS; CORRUPTION; COUNTRIES","Sustainable development; renewable energy; non-renewable energy; endogeneity; panel data analysis","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Guney, T","[Guney, Taner] Karamanoglu Mehmetbey Univ, Dept Econ, Karaman, Turkey.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Aidt TS, 2009, OXFORD REV ECON POL, V25, P271, DOI 10.1093/oxrep/grp012##Aidt TokeS., 2010, CORRUPTION SUSTAINAB##Alesina A, 2003, J ECON GROWTH, V8, P155, DOI 10.1023/A:1024471506938##ANDERSON TW, 1981, J AM STAT ASSOC, V76, P598, DOI 10.2307/2287517##Apergis N., 2014, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V4, P578##Apergis N, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V127, P1011, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.043##Apergis N, 2010, ENERG ECON, V32, P1392, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2010.06.001##Apergis N, 2010, ECOL ECON, V69, P2255, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.06.014##ARELLANO M, 1991, REV ECON STUD, V58, P277, DOI 10.2307/2297968##ARELLANO M, 1995, J ECONOMETRICS, V68, P29, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01642-D##Arrow K, 2004, J ECON PERSPECT, V18, P147, DOI 10.1257/0895330042162377##Azapagic A, 2000, PROCESS SAF ENVIRON, V78, P243, DOI 10.1205/095758200530763##Ben Jebli M, 2016, ECOL INDIC, V60, P824, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.031##Ben Jebli M, 2015, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V22, P12050, DOI 10.1007/s11356-015-4483-x##Ben Jebli M, 2015, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V47, P173, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.049##Bilgili F, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V71, P830, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.109##Blundell R, 1998, J ECONOMETRICS, V87, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00009-8##BOZKURT C, 2015, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V5, P507##Clemens M., 2002, MANUAL CALCULA UNPUB##Dincer I, 2000, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V4, P157, DOI 10.1016/S1364-0321(99)00011-8##Dogan E, 2016, RENEW ENERG, V94, P429, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.078##Elum ZA, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V76, P72, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.040##Guney T, 2017, J INT TRADE ECON DEV, V26, P316, DOI 10.1080/09638199.2016.1249391##Gupta S., 2002, ECON GOV, V3, P23, DOI DOI 10.1007/S101010100039##Hall RE, 1999, Q J ECON, V114, P83, DOI 10.1162/003355399555954##Hamilton K, 1999, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V13, P333, DOI 10.1093/wber/13.2.333##Hamilton K., 2005, 2498 WORLD BANK##La Porta R, 1999, J LAW ECON ORGAN, V15, P222, DOI 10.1093/jleo/15.1.222##La Porta R, 1998, J POLIT ECON, V106, P1113, DOI 10.1086/250042##Liu X, 2017, J CLEAN PROD, V164, P1239, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.086##MAURO P, 1995, Q J ECON, V110, P681, DOI 10.2307/2946696##Menyah K, 2010, ENERG POLICY, V38, P2911, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.01.024##Ocal O., 2013, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V3, P193##Ozturk I, 2011, APPL ENERG, V88, P2885, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.01.065##Roodman D., 2006, CTR GLOBAL DEV WORKI##Sinha A., 2015, INT J ENERGY EC POL, V5, P96##Solarin SA, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V80, P1578, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.07.028##Soytas U, 2003, ENERG ECON, V25, P33, DOI 10.1016/S0140-9883(02)00009-9##Spaiser V, 2019, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V26, P282, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2018.1559252##Stock, 2005, IDENTIFICATION INFER, P80, DOI [10.1017/CBO9780511614491.006, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511614491.006]##Tatoglu F., 2012, ILERI PANEL VERI ANA##TREIA, 2015, DEF REN EN##Tugcu CT, 2012, ENERG ECON, V34, P1942, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2012.08.021##UN, 2016, AFF CLEAN EN WHY IT##UNFCCC, 2015, OUTC UN CLIM CHANG C",27,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM6","no","SDG.7"

We analysed some 29 000 crashes recorded in Namibia between 2012 and 2015 to identify connections between road safety and sustainable development there and, by extension, throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries. The results indicate that the heavy reliance on transport services for basic mobility, especially in rural areas, contributes to negative development outcomes in terms of significant burden of injuries and death, many of which affect younger people of prime working age. The results also suggest that development pressures such as increased commercial traffic and more private vehicles increase the burden of roadway crashes. Many of the underlying factors contributing to these crashes are attributable to driving behaviours and safety cultures that must be addressed as part of programmatic socioeconomic development in order to mitigate the negative effects of transportation and more fully realise its potential to support sustainable development. We document additional ways in which the provision of safe transport is interrelated to successful attainment of the broader SDGs including those not explicitly addressing safe transport such as 4, 5, 8, 9, 16, and 17.","SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; TRAFFIC INJURIES; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; MOBILITY; SAFETY; DRIVERS; BURDEN; HEALTH","Namibia; road safety; sustainable development; latent class analysis","DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA","Jones, S##Odero, K##Adan, EK","[Jones, Steven] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Box 870205, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.

Correct assessment of the risk premium is essential for sustainable valuation. Generally, it is estimated that traditional financial models or historic rates do not take into account the specific risk factors of an investment project. In this paper, we propose a sustainable model to obtain it. It is based on investment risk factors and the urban planning land development stages. We conducted a study in Badajoz, Spain, on four urban stages: first, land without an execution program; second, land with an execution program; third, land with reparceling; and fourth, fully developed and urbanized land. We calculated one different risk premium value for each urban stage. The results show that with this model, we can obtain the risk premium at any time during urban planning development. The urban stage is one of the most influential factors in the risk premium value. It decreases during urban planning development, and fully developed and urbanized land has a lower risk premium.","ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; REAL-ESTATE; DECISION","development urban planning; risk premium; socio-economy; sustainable land value","SUSTAINABILITY","Rodas, JMC##Fernandez, JC##Gomez, JMN##Castanho, RA","[Codosero Rodas, Jose Maria; Cabezas Fernandez, Jose] Univ Extremadura, Environm Resources Anal Res Grp ARAM, Badajoz 06006, Spain.

"J","WOS:000486221900008",2019,"Sustainable development of communities: ISO 37120 and UN goals","Purpose The aims of this study is to put on the agenda discussions concerning the approach of sustainable goals and indicators, in terms of how they relate to each other and how to list their importance within a network of contemporary city management. From the millennium objectives experience, UN has launched the continuity of the development program, through the sustainable development goals (SDG), which have the purpose of giving support to local and regional governments for the 2030 agenda in local sphere. In the city context, sustainable development has also been approached in regulations, like ISO 37120: 2017 ""Sustainable development of communities: Indicators for city services and quality of life"". These instruments have in common the concern of offering parameters of public services to citizens and promoting in a uniform manner both social and economic growth of the urban environment. Design/methodology/approach The present study aims to compare these two sustainable development tools by means of a documentary analysis and to analyze the feasibility of the proposed indicators and their qualitative evaluation goals to improve citizens' quality of life. Findings The results suggest that the main urban challenges are related to unplanned urban growth and poor-quality public services, which generate a lack of commitment to enforce laws and to achieve sustainable development goals. Originality/value The study establishes bases for guiding the discussion to support managers and investors decisions to promote paradigm changes in the citizens' life and in the way cities are planned.",NA,"Sustainability; Sustainable development","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Moschen, SA##Macke, J##Bebber, S##da Silva, MBC","[Moschen, Suane A.; Macke, Janaina; Bebber, Suelen; Correa da Silva, Marcelo Benetti] Univ Caxias do Sul, Grad Program Business Adm, Caxias Do Sul, Brazil.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Education & Educational Research","AssociacAo Brasileira de Normas Tecnicas, 2017, 37120 NBR ISO ASS BR, P87##Chandran R., 2016, MANAGING MAJOR RISKS##Dempsey N, 2011, SUSTAIN DEV, V19, P289, DOI 10.1002/sd.417##Filho WL, 2019, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V26, P179, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2018.1505674##Griggs D, 2013, NATURE, V495, P305, DOI 10.1038/495305a##Hawken P., 1999, NATURAL CAPITALISM N##Le Blanc D, 2015, SUSTAIN DEV, V23, P176, DOI 10.1002/sd.1582##Leal W, 2018, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V25, P131, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2017.1342103##Lehner A, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su10041268##Leite C., 2012, CIDADES SUSTENTAVEIS##MEADOWS D, 1992, LIMITS GLOBAL COLLAP##Pimentel A, 2001, CADERNOS PESQUISA, P179, DOI DOI 10.1590/SOI00-15742001000300008##Sneddon C, 2006, ECOL ECON, V57, P253, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.04.013##United Nations Sustainable Development, 2015, SUST DEV GOALS",7,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM4","no","SDG.11#SDG.8"
"J","WOS:000487231200068",2019,"Inadequate adaptation of geospatial information for sustainable mining towards agenda 2030 sustainable development goals","For all the evolutionary ages of mineral resource development, there have not been concerns about sustainable mining until the 21st century. Thus, this paper explores the extent to which emerging geospatial technologies have been deliberately used in the mining industry activities to achieve the United Nations Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Governments, the mining industry, Non-Governmental and International Organisations have various investments in geospatial programmes and technologies for Environmental and Social Impact Assessments and baseline studies to enhance the achievement of these goals. However, these efforts prove inadequate to link the social, environmental and economic baseline analysis of sustainable development goals. The observations in this paper, therefore, have been obtained largely from extensive literature review to gain a broad understanding of previous and current applications of emerging technologies in the field. The literature has been explored in two successive steps. First, the literature was broadly queried to find the most current works on sustainable mining for three decades (i.e. 1990 to 2019). Second, out of over 100 papers, reports, and books retrieved in the first step, a more specific search and analysis of existing academic and industry literature on the explicit applications of emerging geospatial technology for enhancing sustainable development in the mining sector was conducted. In spite of its ensemble of capabilities for multivariate analysis, analysis of the literature reveals that there is inadequate adaptation of emerging geospatial technologies, which can simultaneously measure and link generally acceptable social, economic and environmental costs and benefits of mining for sustainability considerations in a local setting. There is a dearth of literature that discuss this new approach in addressing sustainable mining. Findings of this paper shall, therefore, inform the scientific community, industry, Non-Governmental Organisations and consultants on emerging approaches to address salient issues of sustainable mining towards meeting the agenda 2030 SDGs.

"J","WOS:000487361700001",2019,"Sustainable development: Meaning, history, principles, pillars, and implications for human action: Literature review","Sustainable development (SD) has become a popular catchphrase in contemporary development discourse. However, in spite of its pervasiveness and the massive popularity it has garnered over the years, the concept still seems unclear as many people continue to ask questions about its meaning and history, as well as what it entails and implies for development theory and practice. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the discourse on SD by further explaining the paradigm and its implications for human thinking and actions in the quest for sustainable development. This is done through extensive literature review, combining aspects of the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Recursive Content ion (RCA) analytical approach. The paper finds and argues that the entire issue of sustainable development centres around inter- and intragenerational equity anchored essentially on three-dimensional distinct but interconnected pillars, namely the environment, economy, and society. Decision-makers need to be constantly mindful of the relationships, complementarities, and trade-offs among these pillars and ensure responsible human behaviour and actions at the international, national, community and individual levels in order to uphold and promote the tenets of this paradigm in the interest of human development. More needs to be done by the key players-particularly the United Nations (UN), governments, private sector, and civil society organisations-in terms of policies, education and regulation on social, economic and environmental resource management to ensure that everyone is sustainable development aware, conscious, cultured and compliant.","DEVELOPMENT GOALS; ENVIRONMENT; BIODIVERSITY; ORGANIZATIONS; PROTECTION; MANAGEMENT; UNIVERSAL; ORIGINS; IMPACT; LINE","sustainable development; sustainable development goals; economic sustainability; social sustainability; environmental sustainability","COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES","Mensah, J","[Mensah, Justice] Univ Cape Coast, Acad Planning & Qual Assurance, Cape Coast, Ghana.","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Social Sciences - Other Topics","ABUBAKAR IR, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI DOI 10.3390/SU9040547##Acemoglu D., 2012, WHY NATIONS FAIL ORI##Allen C., 2012, GREEN EC GREEN GROWT##Allen C, 2019, SUSTAIN SCI, V14, P421, DOI 10.1007/s11625-018-0596-8##Basiago A.

"J","WOS:000487936100099",2019,"Sustainable development discourse in Smart Specialization Strategies","Smart Specialization Strategies have been used to implement European Union Cohesion Policy in recent years, aiming to achieve economic, social and territorial development by reducing disparities between regions. The European Union often declares an alignment between Cohesion Policy, Smart Specialization Strategies and the United Nations Agenda 2030. However, and despite the recurrent Sustainable Development discourse present in the European political agenda, it is not evident that Smart Specialization Strategies integrate Sustainable Development goals and practices. Hence, this paper aims to explore and discuss the degree of embeddedness of the Sustainable Development discourse in the Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialization, using the Portuguese Centro Region as an exploratory study. In this research a content analysis of the Centro Region Smart Specialization Strategy was used for data collection and analysis, framed by the 17 goals of Agenda 2030 and their targets. Results show a good embeddedness of the overall goals of Agenda 2030, but a lower integration of the targets, suggesting that this strategy needs to be revisited to further integrate Agenda 2030. Moreover, the Centro Smart Specialization Strategy has a strong alignment with the goals related with economic and environmental issues, almost disregarding social aspects. These findings are amplified by the fact that this strategy is mainly being implemented through projects financed under the economy pillar. Finally, there is evidence about the need of developing regional innovation policies towards sustainable development from the regional to the national level. Overall, it is critical to enlarge the debate on how Smart Specialization Strategies can be an effective engine for a new development trajectory for European regions assuming the Agenda 2030 as a framework for the necessary change.

"J","WOS:000488622800026",2019,"Indicator Analysis of the Economic Development of Polish Regions in the Context of the Implementation of the Concept of Sustainable Development","The aim of the article is to present the regional differentiation of indicators characterizing the economic development of Polish regions in the context of the progress made in the implementation of the concept of sustainable development in 2010 and 2017. The authors focused primarily on determining the position of Lubuskie Province on the economic map of Poland. The article proposes a set of indicators monitoring one of the areas of sustainable development - economic development, which also take into account other areas of sustainable development, i.e. social development, environmental development, and institutional-political development. The main criterion for the selection of indicators were substantive premises and their completeness and accessibility across the regions. The analysis and evaluation of the proposed indicators (explanatory variables) were conducted within five thematic areas which mark the economic development of the regions and which are important from the standpoint of the sustainable development concept: 1) Potential of the economy 2) Innovativeness of the economy 3) Economic activity of enterprises, 4) Production and transportation, 5) Economic activity of households. The article consists of two sections. In the first section, based on literature review, the most important issues regarding the concept of sustainable development and the state of scientific research on the indicators of sustainable development at regional level are presented. The second section addresses the concept of indicator analysis on the basis of which an assessment of economic development of 16 Polish regions was carried out and the position of Lubuskie Province was determined against the backdrop of the other regions. The findings prompted an answer to the question concerning the economic development of Polish regions, and in particular of Lubuskie Province, in the context of the concept of sustainable development.",NA,"indicator analysis; region; sustainable development; economic development; Poland","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Barska, A##Jedrzejczak-Gas, J","[Barska, Anetta; Jedrzejczak-Gas, Janina] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Zielona Gora, Poland.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","[Anonymous], 2011, WSKAZNIKI ZROWNOWAZO##Bal-Domanska B., 2016, OPTIMUM STUDIA EKONO##Borys T, 2003, ZARZADZANIE ZROWNOWA##Borys T, 2011, PROBL EKOROZW, V6, P75##Brutland G.

"J","WOS:000488623700020",2019,"The Role of Multinational Enterprises in Achieving Sustainable Development - The Case of Huawei","The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between business and sustainable development, particularly the role of multinational enterprises (MNEs) as possible driving force for achieving sustainability. By following an inductive case study approach and referring to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, the sustainable undertakings of the Chinese MNE Huawei are explored. Published data on Huawei's website and online resources like annual reports, news announcements, sustainability and corporate social responsibility reports are used for this purpose. The main findings indicate that Huawei can promote sustainable development internationally on three different levels: (1) products/services, (2) business operations and (3) social contributions. Based on these findings, a systematic framework is derived to help illustrate possible and classify existing MNE's sustainability activities, as well as the related main stakeholders. This paper is useful for scholars and practitioners alike as it shows the compatibility of success in business with sustainability, as well as the potential of MNEs to contribute to sustainable development.","SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; BUSINESS; INVESTMENT; STRATEGY; GREEN","Sustainable Development Goals; business; multinational enterprises; emerging markets","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Berning, SC","[Berning, Sue Claire] Tech Univ Ingolstadt, Business Sch, Ingolstadt, Germany.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Ambec S, 2008, ACAD MANAGE PERSPECT, V23, P45, DOI 10.5465/AMP.2008.35590353##Bryson JR, 2009, BUS STRATEG ENVIRON, V18, P97, DOI 10.1002/bse.640##Clegg LJ, 2018, MANAGE INT REV, V58, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11575-017-0341-z##Cooke B, 2004, ORGANIZATION, V11, P603, DOI 10.1177/1350508404044063##Cui L, 2012, J INT BUS STUD, V43, P264, DOI 10.1057/jibs.2012.1##De Backer K, 2003, REV IND ORGAN, V22, P67, DOI 10.1023/A:1022180317898##Dunning JH, 2007, MULTINATL BUS REV, V15, P25, DOI 10.1108/1525383X200700002##Eccles RG, 2013, J APPL CORP FINANC, V25, P8, DOI 10.1111/jacf.12023##Elkington J., 1997, CANNIBALS FORKS TRIP##Guo L, 2019, ASIA PAC J MANAG, V36, P849, DOI 10.1007/s10490-018-9580-1##Hall JK, 2010, J BUS VENTURING, V25, P439, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusvent.2010.01.002##HART SL, 1995, ACAD MANAGE REV, V20, P986, DOI 10.2307/258963##Hill C, 2012, INT BUSINESS##Jensen O, 2010, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V18, P615, DOI 10.1080/09669581003615590##Kolk A, 2006, WORLD DEV, V34, P789, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.10.005##Kolk A, 2016, J WORLD BUS, V51, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2015.08.010##Low B, 2007, J BUS IND MARK, V22, P138, DOI 10.1108/08858620710730258##Lowe N, 1999, WORLD DEV, V27, P1427, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(99)00064-9##Luo YD, 2011, ORGAN DYN, V40, P67, DOI 10.1016/j.orgdyn.2010.10.010##Milne MJ, 2013, J BUS ETHICS, V118, P13, DOI 10.1007/s10551-012-1543-8##Oetzel J, 2009, J WORLD BUS, V44, P108, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2008.05.001##Orlitzky M, 2003, ORGAN STUD, V24, P403, DOI 10.1177/0170840603024003910##Prahalad CK, 2002, HARVARD BUS REV, V80, P48##Rodriguez M.A., 2002, CREAT INNOV MANAG, V11, P135##Siegel DS, 2009, ACAD MANAGE PERSPECT, V23, P5##Yin JL, 2016, LONG RANGE PLANN, V49, P541, DOI 10.1016/j.lrp.2015.12.024",1,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM11","no","SDG.9#SDG.8"

The use of electronic citizen involvement tools provides numerous changes in the relationship between the citizen and public institution, especially by boosting citizen engagement in decision making Civic participation is a key factor in determining effective and inclusive governance at the local and national levels. As many organizations have recognized, contemporary democracy needs to ensure a responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making process, emphasizing the importance of those sustainable development factors. Moreover, National Councils for Sustainable Development were once considered critical to achieving integration in decision-making and participation, two dimensions that were at the heart of the sustainable development concept. The article presents citizen e-participation as an important factor for sustainable development. The purpose is to explain theoretical and empirical meaning of citizen e-participation for sustainable development. To achieve this goal, the authors used the following research methods: critical review of the literature and quantitative data analysis (data examined come from author's own research (2018) into use and willingness to use e-government tools by Poles).

The idea of sustainable development includes the economy, the society and the environment. In the context of sustainable development, the subject of animal welfare is being increasingly regarded as essential. Ensuring animal welfare is now the key issue for public opinion, livestock farmers, animal rights organizations, entrepreneurs, transport companies and slaughterhouses. Animal welfare should be applied according to Five Freedoms, which are: freedom from hunger and thirst, freedom from pain and injury, freedom from physical discomfort, freedom to express normal behavior, freedom from stress and fear. The purpose of this article is to present the current state of awareness about ensuring animal welfare as an element of sustainable development on the example of Polish companies which transport animals to slaughterhouses. As a research method the authors used the survey method. The questionnaire was addressed to the owners of enterprises transporting slaughter animals and to drivers of these enterprises. The results found out that there is a serious need to change the operation of the transport system due to ethical aspects.","WELFARE; CATTLE; LEVEL","Sustainable development; animal welfare; animal transport; transport management","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Budzik, A##Budzik, T","[Budzik, Anna; Budzik, Tomasz] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Czestochowa, Poland.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Albinska E., 2013, PRZEMYSLOWY CHOW ZWI##[Anonymous], 2017, LISTA KONTROLNA DLA##[Anonymous], 2017, 5 NAJGLOSNIEJSZYCH S##Armeanu DS, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su10010004##Bluszcz A, 2018, SOC INDIC RES, V139, P679, DOI 10.1007/s11205-017-1746-6##Bluszcz A, 2016, QUAL QUANT, V50, P2607, DOI 10.1007/s11135-015-0285-y##Bombik T., 2013, PRZEGLAD HODOWLANY, V81, P26##Brambell F.W.R., 1965, REPORT TECHNICAL COM##Broom D.

As would be observed in the present study, when the comparison between countries on their progresses in well-being and economy is desirable, gathering indicators of both environmental and development pillars of the SD as performed in the SDG index construction can be misleading. Based on the SDG index and with the aim of better monitoring and assessing countries' SD levels, the current study introduces a composite index called DEVI which merely consists of the ""development goals indicators."" The DEVI showed a high correlation with the human development index. The lack of separation between the developed and developing countries in the SDGs is a disadvantage especially when various interactions with different countries are considered according to their different development levels. In this regard, by innovating a combined statistics-based algorithm, compatible with the available conventional lists for developed countries, countries are classified based on the similarities in their DEVI scores into the developed and developing countries. Applying this algorithm, it determined 43 and 40 countries as developed countries in 2017 and 2018, respectively.","DEVELOPMENT GOALS; METHODOLOGY","SDG index; Sustainable Development Goals; Developed countries; Development levels","ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY","Jabbari, M##Motlagh, MS##Ashrafi, K##Abdoli, G","[Jabbari, Mehdi; Motlagh, Majid Shafiepour; Ashrafi, Khosro] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Environm, Dept Environm Engn, Qods St,Enghelab Ave, Tehran, Iran.

"J","WOS:000496456400004",2019,"Climate change and sustainable development for cities","Under the current background of global warming, extreme weather and climate events, such as heavy precipitation and heat wave events, have increased in most land areas of the world. Meanwhile, in cities, the intensity and frequency of heat waves and heavy precipitation events have further increased as the urban climate has additionally been affected by rapid land surface change, enhanced anthropogenic heat release, and massive aerosol emissions. These enhanced aerosol emissions also deteriorate the air quality, often causing severe air quality problems in cities. The added urbanization effect on global and regional climate change has imposed increasingly serious impacts on the dense population, heavy traffic, vast infrastructure, and economic assets of urban areas. China has experienced much faster warming than the global average from the late of 20st century, especially since 1990. The average warming rate in the seven largest cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Chongqing) is higher than the average for China as a whole during the most recent 60 years. The number of hot days with maximum surface air temperatures over 35 degrees C has increased markedly since 1990. In the past two decades, many cities, such as Beijing, Jinan, and Chongqing have experienced extremely heavy precipitation events, causing dozens of fatalities. During the past 50 years, severe air pollution conditions have frequently occurred in many cities over eastern China. In South China, the Huanghe-Huaihe River Basin and North China, increasing trends in the number of haze days are evident. Influenced by global warming, cities in low-lying coastal areas are highly susceptible to sea level rise and the related impacts of sea water encroachment, especially during tropical cyclone and storm surge periods. In cities in northern China and inland areas, climate change-related drought frequently significantly impacts water resources and ecosystem services. In recent years, the issue of urban climate change has received considerable attention in China. Many climate change adaptation strategies have been put into action in cities. Also, urban areas account for about 75% of energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide, and thus play a dominant role in the mitigation of global greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, increased urban climate change and its impacts greatly challenge the social, economic and ecological sustainable development of China's cities. In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, at the heart of which are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Goal 11, on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, directly targets dealing with the challenges brought by urbanization. Many other goals, such as Goal 13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, Goal 3 on ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing, Goal 6 on ensuring access to water and sanitation, and Goal 15 on protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, are all related to tackling climate change issues from the perspectives of human security and health, more resilient economies, and ecosystems. Obviously, implementation of these United Nations SDGs brings immediate impetus and new opportunities for climate change responses in cities. In the future, the impacts of global climate change and urbanization are expected to further increase. Cities will face more serious and complicated climate change risks to human health, economic development, and ecosystem services as our expectation of more hazards, higher exposure and vulnerability unfolds. For China, climate change and sustainable development in cities is an extremely prominent issue. However, systematic studies on climate change in cities are very limited, especially in terms of the interactions and mechanisms between global/regional climate change and urbanization processes, high-resolution climate change projections under the consideration of future urban development pathways, impact and risk assessments of climate change in combination with high exposure and vulnerability, and a portfolio of response options and measures for climate change in cities. Effective climate change actions rely on understanding the complexity and uncertainties of future climate change and related risks in cities. Under the framework of sustainable development, following related national green development strategies and polices, taking advantages of science, technology, finance and governance in cities, to actively tackle urban climate change issues, such as enhanced adaptation and mitigation measures, properly selecting development pathways will greatly enhance climate resilience in cities. A series of national actions, such as implementing ""low carbon cities"" and ""sponge cities"", and the ""Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution"", will have co-benefits for climate change responses and sustainable development in cities.","URBAN; PRECIPITATION; URBANIZATION; POLLUTION; IMPACTS; HAZARD; CHINA; WATER; RISK","climate change; urbanization; sustainable development; extreme events","CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE","Zhai, PM##Yuan, YF##Yu, R##Guo, JP","[Zhai, Panmao; Yu, Rong; Guo, Jianping] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000496506600030",2019,"Harvesting synergy from sustainable development goal interactions","As countries pursue sustainable development across sectors as diverse as health, agriculture, and infrastructure, sectoral policies interact, generating synergies that alter their effectiveness. Identifying those synergies ex ante facilitates the harmonization of policies and provides an important lever to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. However, identifying and quantifying these synergetic interactions are infeasible with traditional approaches to policy analysis. In this paper, we present a method for identifying synergies and assessing them quantitatively. We also introduce a typology of 5 classes of synergies that enables an understanding of their causal structures. We operationalize the typology in pilot studies of SDG strategies undertaken in Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and Malawi. In the pilots, the integrated SDG (iSDG) model was used to simulate the effects of policies over the SDG time horizon and to assess the contributions of synergies. Synergy contributions to overall SDG performance were 7% for Cote d'Ivoire, 0.7% for Malawi, and 2% for Senegal. We estimate the value of these contributions to be 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) for Cote d'Ivoire, 0.4% for Malawi, and 0.7% for Senegal. We conclude that enhanced understanding of synergies in sustainable development planning can contribute to progress on the SDGs-and free substantial amounts of resources.","SDGS","sustainable development goals; SDGs; synergy; integrated policy","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","Pedercini, M##Arquitt, S##Collste, D##Herren, H","[Pedercini, Matteo; Arquitt, Steve; Collste, David; Herren, Hans] Millennium Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA.

It contributes to the development of this relatively new topic, offering a critical evaluation and identifying the highest impact research strands. The Web of Science database returned 111 documents spanning the period 1997-2018, and a conceptual science mapping analysis based on co-word bibliographic networks was developed, using SciMAT as an analytical tool. The motor themes (well developed and important for the structure of the discipline) in the field of sustainable HRM are environmental management, socially responsible HRM, and turnover. Employee engagement is a specialised theme (well developed but less important for the structure of the research field), human resource practices is a basic or transversal theme (important for the discipline but not developed), and sustainable leadership and environmental performance are emerging themes (both weakly developed and marginal to the field).","CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY;

In this study, we examine the synergy effect of renewable electricity on selected SDG5 via the electricity prices for the European Union (EU) countries. Using panel data and a two-step estimation approach, our findings indicate a strong synergy effect between renewable electricity prices, SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). The results further reveal that SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption) accounts for most of the future renewable electricity price variation (excluding self-effect), whereas future variation in SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (climate action) are explained mostly by SDG 8 and SDG 12, respectively.

At a global level it has been concluded that economic development in the absence of any concern related to the regeneration, preservation and protection of natural resources and the environment forfuture generations is not healthy and can have disastrous consequences in the long run. That is why, at EU level, there have been continuing concerns for sustainable economic development since as early as 2006. Increasing concerns over sustainable development as a goal for European society and economy have led to search for adequate indicators to measure it. Within this context, based on statistical indicators that reflect the intensity of the determinants, we propose to construct a composite index that reflects the extent to which the concept of sustainable development is assimilated by the economies of the EU countries. The composite index comprises over 140 sustainable development indicators structured along the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. On the basis of this index, we ranked and compared EU countries according to the degree of implementation of the sustainable economic development in the national economies of the EU countries.",NA,"composite index; sustainable development; EU countries","TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS","Turturean, CI##Asandului, LA##Chirila, C##Homocianu, D","[Turturean, Ciprian Ionel; Asandului, Laura Anca; Chirila, Ciprian; Homocianu, Daniel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Bvd Carol 1 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.","Business; Economics","Business & Economics","Barrera-Roldan A., 2002, ECOL INDIC, V2, P251, DOI [10.1016/S1470-160X(02)00058-4, DOI 10.1016/S1470-160X(02)00058-4]##Bartelmus P, 2008, QUANTITATIVE EC SUST##Bossel H, 1999, INDICATORS SUSTAINAB##Daly H.

The basis to reach sustainable development is innovation, which plays a role on all dimensions, be it economically, socially, or environmentally. In this review, science mapping techniques were employed in order to asses 1690 journal articles extracted from the SCOPUS database concerned with innovation in sustainable development (ISD). The main objective of the review is to reveal the size, growth trajectory, and geographic distribution of the ISD literature. Furthermore, the aim is to assess the key publishing journals, authors, and documents as well as to uncover the intellectual structure and topical foci of the research domain. The review acknowledges a reasonable body of knowledge spanning nearly three decades. A result of this review is that the sustainable development literature emerged from the environmental research field and that the topical foci of the domain is closely aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. This review is a first attempt to systematically analyze the literature on innovation in sustainable development (ISD) by applying science mapping techniques such as bibliometric analysis. It shall give guidance for future research and demonstrate the practical implications.","BUSINESS MODEL; EVOLUTION; CITATION; SCIENCE; SCOPUS; FIELD; WEB","sustainable development; sustainable development goals (SDG); innovation; sustainability; science mapping; bibliometric review","SUSTAINABILITY","Vatananan-Thesenvitz, R##Schaller, AA##Shannon, R","[Vatananan-Thesenvitz, Ronald; Schaller, Amaury-Alexandre] Bangkok Univ, IKI SEA, Bangkok 10110, Thailand.

"J","WOS:000498398900317",2019,"Development of a Composite Measure of Regional Sustainable Development in Indonesia","Sustainable development has been the main agenda for Indonesia's development at both the national and regional levels. Along with laws concerning the national development plan and regional development that mandate a sustainable development framework, the government has issued President Regulation No. 59/2017 on the implementation of sustainable development goals. The issuance of these recent regulatory frameworks indicates that sustainable development should be taken seriously in development processes. Nevertheless, several factors affect the achievement of sustainable development. This paper investigates how economic, social, and environmental factors could be integrated into regional sustainable development indicators using a new composite index. The index is calculated based on a simple formula that could be useful for practical implementation at the policy level. Three measures of indices are developed: arithmetic, geometric, and entropy-based. The indices are aggregated to be used for comparison purposes among regions in terms of their sustainability performance. Lessons learned are then drawn for policy analysis and several recommendations are provided to address challenges in the implementation stages.","INDICATORS; INDEX","regional sustainable development index; sustainable development; composite index; regional development goals","SUSTAINABILITY","Rahma, H##Fauzi, A##Juanda, B##Widjojanto, B","[Rahma, Hania] Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business, Kampus UI Salemba, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia.

Critical discourse analysis of perspectives on the private sector in sustainable development","Critical discourse analysis is employed to examine discourses of the private sector within key texts of the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. Taking a genealogical approach, four discourses are identified in the literature: the dominant, pro-private sector discourse, showing unconditional support for the private sector; the sceptical discourse; the middle-ground discourse with new approaches, specifically designed to leverage development relevance; and the antiprivate sector discourse, which considers that current approaches to the private sector will not be conducive to sustainable development of the global South. The pro-private sector discourse was found to be predominant within the global goals, reflecting the post-Washington Consensus as well as the role of the developed countries and the corporate sector in their formulation. All discourses on the private sector, however, place an emphasis on economic and social development at the expense of the key environmental component of sustainable development.","MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; WASHINGTON CONSENSUS; DEVELOPMENT POLICY; TRADE","critical discourse analysis; international development; Millennium Development Goals; private sector; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Cummings, S##Seferiadis, AA##de Haan, L","[Cummings, Sarah] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Athena Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

"J","WOS:000500383800007",2019,"Green port marketing for sustainable growth and development","There are increasing concerns on the environmental impact of port operations and development due to pressing global issues such as climate change and energy conservation. From the sustainability perspective, a port should manage and balance three bottom lines, namely economic prosperity, social wellbeing, and environmental quality. A major driver for sustainability is to attract and retain customers who value sustainability. As such, formulating a green port marketing plan fulfilling the economic, social, and environmental objectives will guide a port towards sustainable growth and development. The study aims to investigate the green marketing status of the world's major ports. With reference to green marketing theories, these ports' green marketing status is reflected by their strategies, structures, and functions. Cross case analysis is performed to identify patterns and trends across the various ports for benchmarking and thereby derive green marketing orientation. The cross case analysis also adds value by representing an international perspective from the major ports in key geographical regions. The results show that more than half of the 30 cases are actively engaged in green marketing. However, ports focus more on strategies, and less on structures and functions. It is recommended that ports should connect the three essential aspects in green marketing efforts.","SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; EMERGING PORT; LOGISTICS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; POLICY; POLLUTION; SECTOR; SHIPS; TOOLS","Green port; Green marketing; Green marketing orientation; Sustainable development; Cross case analysis; Environment","TRANSPORT POLICY","Lam, JSL##Li, KX","[Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Maritime Energy & Sustainable Dev Ctr Excellence, Singapore, Singapore.

As a way of action, it refers to the increase in the quality of education for all and the integration of critical and innovative approaches. Given this scenario, the socioformative approach is postulated, since it seeks to transcend the concept of learning, focusing on the transcendence of the classroom to social, organizational and community environments.

"J","WOS:000501647300026",2020,"The Southern origins of sustainable development goals: Ideas, actors, aspirations","With the increasing importance of 'emerging powers' in the global economy, questions are raised about the role of developing countries in shaping global norms. The assumption in much of the literature has been to see global norms as originating in the 'North' (or the 'West'). Recent research has begun to challenge this view. This paper contributes to this debate in studying the agency of the South in the adoption of sustainable development as the consensus framework for international development (SDGs). Based on documentary and archival research, interviews with stakeholders, and direct participant observation of the SDG negotiations and consultations, the paper chronicles the ideas originating from the South in the emergence and subsequent evolution of the sustainable development concept and the adoption of the SDGs. We highlight the role of key individuals as norm entrepreneurs at the origin of sustainable development as they challenged the North-led understanding of the environmental challenge in the 1970s and 1980s, and the agency of Southern actors in proposing an alternative vision as a successor to the MDGs. We chronicle the agency of Southern actors in promoting some key priorities of sustainable development. We argue that these ideas originated from the perspective of the knowledge, lived experience, policy experience, theorizing and analysis of the Global South. We find that norm entrepreneurship involved contesting mainstream views and advancing marginalized ideas. The case also illustrates international norm emergence as a long term process of contestation and evolution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"J","WOS:000502563300002",2019,"Sustainable Development of the Russian Arctic: Legal Implications","Sustainable development has increasingly entered into the Arctic context. For Russia, the Arctic means enormous natural resources and potential for the country's social and economic well-being. The focus of this paper is the dynamics of environmental and Arctic legislation in Russia; attention is also given to the rationale and justification of legal implications of sustainable development in the Russian Arctic. Specifically, it discusses barriers in transitioning to sustainable development and estimates relevant legal tools used over the last three decades applicable to the Arctic territories. The general idea is that despite strong political will to promote sustainable development, Russia's unstable economy has impeded the country's sustainability development objectives. Consequently, resource-based development is prioritized over environmental concerns and puts environmentally fragile territories, like the Arctic, at great risk. The research methods include context analysis of the Russian federal and regional laws and contextual interviews at the federal and regional government levels. The results of the research are the identification of achievements and deficiencies in the rule of law related to sustainable development of the Russian Arctic as well as policy recommendations for public authorities. The paper outlines that as long as Russian legislation lacks specific rules addressing sustainability in the Russian Arctic, it would be difficult for the government to implement international principles of sustainable development across this territory.","GLOBAL COMPACT","Sustainable development; Arctic; Russia; strategy; legislation; implementation","NISPACEE JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY","Gladun, E","[Gladun, Elena] Tyumen State Univ, Tyumen, Russia.","Public Administration","Public Administration","Abas N., 2019, ENV SYST RES, V8, P10, DOI [10.1186/s40068-019-0138-0, DOI 10.1186/S40068-019-0138-0]##Andreassen N, 2016, ENERGY RES SOC SCI, V16, P78, DOI 10.1016/j.erss.2016.03.015##[Anonymous], 2009, STRATEGIC ACTION PRO##[Anonymous], 2013, STRATEGIYA RAZVITIYA##[Anonymous], 2005, HUMAN DEV REPORT##[Anonymous], 2016, IMPL CONC SUST DEV I##[Anonymous], 2004, RUIE C##[Anonymous], 2011, IND PEOPL OIL GAS IN##[Anonymous], 2006, ENV POLICY REGULATIO##Antipov A.N., 2006, LANDSCAPE PLANNING T##Armand D.A., 1964, NAM VNUKAM##Barlybaev Khalil, 2001, PUT CHELOVECHESTVA S##Bobylev S., 2013, SUSTAINABLE DEV RUSS, P11##Bobylev Sergei N., 2005, HUMAN DEV REPORT 200##Bobylev Sergei N., 2004, TRANSITIONING SUSTAI, V26, P5##Bruda Michail A., 2017, POSTSOVIET ISSUES, V4, p373##Crotty J, 2003, COMMUNIS POST-COMMUN, V36, P489, DOI 10.1016/j.postcomstud.2003.09.006##Crotty J, 2014, SUSTAIN DEV, V22, P311, DOI 10.1002/sd.1542##EDELSTEIN MR, 2012, DISASTER DESIGN ARAL##Forbes BC, 2009, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V106, P22041, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0908286106##Gladun E, 2017, BRICS LAW J, V4, P39, DOI 10.21684/2412-2343-2017-4-4-39-64##Gladun E, 2015, NISPACEE J PUBLIC AD, V8, P111, DOI 10.1515/nispa-2015-0006##Gladun Elena, 2015, 20 YEARS NEW CONSTIT, P113##Gomes E, 2017, BRICS LAW J, V4, P93, DOI 10.21684/2412-2343-2017-4-4-93-115##GOOCH GD, 1995, ENVIRON BEHAV, V27, P513, DOI 10.1177/0013916595274004##Gorbachev Mikhail, 1987, COMMUNICATION   1001##Gough S., 2008, HIGHER ED SUSTAINABL##Griewald Y, 2017, LAND USE POLICY, V68, P264, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.049##Jensen L.C., 2015, HDB POLITICS ARCTIC##Josephson PR, 2016, GLOB ENVIRON, V9, P376, DOI 10.3197/ge.2016.090204##Kasimov Nikolai, 2005, STATE MANAGEMENT RES, V3, P8##KAUFMAN RE, 2017, COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHT, V49, P99##Khludeneva Natalia, 2016, PERSPEKTIVY RAZVITIY##Koptyug Valentin A., 2000, NEW PARADIGM RUSSIAN##Kostin A, 2010, WORLD GUIDE TO CSR: A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY ANALYSIS OF CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY, P331##Larsen A.

This paper therefore sets out a Multi-Criteria Model for analyzing the development of sustainability in EU countries (and Norway and Iceland). This required prior filtering and analysis of the data from the Eurostat database. The model was built with the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. Four experts in sustainability participated in the weighting process. The results of the AHP model are identified by areas of sustainability, with the highest value found in Norway, and the rest are found around it forming rings of sustainability, where sustainability decreases the further a country is from Norway. This research could be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each country with regard to sustainable development, and by analyzing the measures taken by Norway and other countries with very high sustainability, by continuous improvement processes, reach similar levels of sustainable development.","FRAMEWORK; LINE","sustainable development; European Union countries; analytic hierarchy process (AHP)","APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL","Martin, CJ##Carnero, C","[Javier Martin, Carlos; Carnero, Carmen] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Tech Sch Ind Engn, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.

Sustainable development implies continuous economic development with respect to environmental principles and focuses on overcoming conflicts between economy and ecology. The aim of this paper is to evaluate sustainable development management in EU countries through selected indicators characterizing sustainable development and its core dimensions. We present the results of an evaluation of the sustainable development of EU countries using cluster analysis. Countries that are similar in terms of sustainability are identified by cluster analysis. Four clusters were separated, the affiliation of each country to a particular cluster was determined, and the characteristics of each cluster were defined. The goal of sustainability management is to create an adequate approach to development of the economic and environmental performance, and therefore achieve sustainability. The achievements of most developed countries should be an incentive for those that are at a lower level of development. In addition, this research provides insight into some specific goals of sustainable development where some countries are lagging behind. This could be the basis for directing efforts in specific areas of sustainable development to improve their own position in such an important global issue.","HEALTH-CARE-SYSTEMS; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; AIR-POLLUTION; AGRICULTURE; INNOVATION; EMISSIONS; EDUCATION; CONTEXT; ENERGY","sustainable development management; sustainable development goal (SDG) indicators; EU countries; cluster analysis","SUSTAINABILITY","Popovic, B##Soja, SJ##Paunovic, T##Maletic, R","[Popovic, Blazenka; Paunovic, Tamara] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Dept Agribusiness Management, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.

"J","WOS:000506899000260",2019,"The Evolution of Sustainable Development Theory: Types, Goals, and Research Prospects","Sustainable development (SD) has become a fundamental strategy to guide the world's social and economic transformation. However, in the process of practice, there are still misinterpretations in regards to the theory of SD. Such misinterpretations are highlighted in the struggle between strong and weak sustainable development paths, and the confusion of the concept of intra-generational and inter-generational justice. In this paper, the literature survey method, induction method, and normative analysis were adopted to clarify the gradual evolution and improvement process of the concept and objective of SD, to strengthen the comprehensive understanding of the SD theory. Moreover, we also tried to bring in the situation and concepts of China. The results show that the theory of SD has gone through three periods: the embryonic period (before 1972), the molding period (1972-1987), and the developing period (1987-present). SD is gradually implemented into a global action from the initial fuzzy concept, including increasing practical wisdom. The goal of SD evolves from pursuing the single goal of sustainable use of natural resources to Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper argues that the theory of strong sustainability should be the accepted concept of SD. Culture, good governance, and life support systems are important factors in promoting SD.","GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; LANDSCAPE; RELEVANT; HEALTH; TRENDS","sustainable development; sustainable development goals; culture; governance","SUSTAINABILITY","Shi, LY##Han, LW##Yang, FM##Gao, LJ","[Shi, Longyu; Han, Linwei; Yang, Fengmei; Gao, Lijie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.

It has been assumed that the increasing popularity of ecological awareness, plays the key role in the implementation of the objectives of sustainable consumption and sustainable development. The aim of this paper is to explain mechanisms responsible for the increasing role of consumption in the modern world and to draw attention to the need to raise the ecological awareness of consumers.

The CSR is an approach that comprises a wide range of components such as corporate governance and workforce diversity. Among them, environmental protection has emerged as an important business issue in recent decades. This study focuses on the environmental protection from corporate efforts measured by CSR and socially responsible investment (SRI) that may serve as a proxy of CSR. This study considers that the level of sustainable development is measured by two unified (operational and environmental) efficiencies. To examine the sustainable development of Japanese manufacturing firms, we utilize a data set consisting of 110 manufacturing companies during 2013-2015. All the companies examined in this study are listed in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This research first applies data envelopment analysis intermediate approach as a holistic method to assess their two efficiency measures. Then, we apply the panel data Tobit estimation to examine whether CSR and/or SRI influence their unified efficiency measures. This research finds that the SRI incorporation increases the efficiencies, enhancing their sustainable developments.

It was found that the relevant aspects of the Constitution on sustainable development are contained in Chapter Two of the Constitution under the fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy, which include environmental, economic and social objectives. The constitution provides for their non-justifiability to the effect that the court shall not entertain any question on implementation of the objectives. Therefore, constitutional basis for sustainable development in Nigeria has been whittled down. It is contended that given the importance of sustainable development to the well-being of Nigerians and the future generations, it is expedient that the provisions of Chapter Two of the constitution relevant to sustainable development be made justiciable in Nigeria.",NA,"sustainable development; constitution of Nigeria; fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy; sustainability","LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW","Oniemola, P##Tasie, O","[Oniemola, Peter] Univ Ibadan, Commercial & Ind Law, Ibadan, Nigeria.

"J","WOS:000513084000001",2020,"Sustainable development education in the context of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development","Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is a concept that evolves in line with emerging sustainability issues. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ESD is embraced in Goal 4, Target 4.7, and reflected in other Goals and Targets. The approach towards the 2030 Agenda is important, not only because of the crucial role that education will play in the implementation of the Goals, but also in increasing its impact by orienting towards the emerging sustainability challenges. Therefore, there is a high demand for research to better understand ESD interactions with the 2030 Agenda framework in specific contexts. This study addresses the implications of Target 4.7 on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, in the context of the Regional Centres of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development as global multi-stakeholder networks. It analyses the interaction of Target 4.7 with other Goals and Targets, in order to identify the strongest connections amongst thematic sustainability issues. The findings revealed through statistical analyses and a comprehensive literature review, that the prevailing components of ESD are strongly interconnected with Goals 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15. Thus reinforcing that the multidimensional aspects of ESD in relation to the SDGs are stronger regarding the current complex issues such as, education, climate, energy, sustainable cities, natural habitat, consumption and production. Although the nature of multi-stakeholder networks allows for diverse approaches of ESD towards the 2030 Agenda, the study indicates the importance of partnership and informal learning for reflection of global sustainability issues in regional platforms.",NA,"Education for sustainable development; SDGs; target","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Shulla, K##Leal, W##Lardjane, S##Sommer, JH##Borgemeister, C","[Shulla, K.; Sommer, J.

"J","WOS:000515621700001",2021,"A literature-based study on the water-energy-food nexus for sustainable development","The water-energy-food (WEF) Nexus encompasses complex and interdependent relations and its examination requires content-specific concepts and approaches. Managing, conserving and maximizing the potential of each component is a major global concern considering the many challenges to be faced in the 21st century. The aim of this study was to identify, in the literature, recommendations for public policy, research and development, and practices for the WEF Nexus, aimed at promoting sustainable development considering stochastic and risk elements. In this regard, this paper presents a literature review of the contribution scientific studies have made toward better understanding the importance of the WEF Nexus in the context of sustainable development. Research indicates that the WEF Nexus cannot be discussed as independent sectors, highlighting the need for integrated policies and inter-sectoral and international cooperation to promote sustainable development. Therefore, the effective management of the WEF Nexus requires science-based data using risk and stochastic elements to assist policy and decision-making. Thus, in a situation of rapid global changes, decision-making processes for this Nexus must be assisted by multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder and cross-sectoral approaches, aimed at avoiding the unintended effects of a single sector approach (e.g., energy policies stimulating hydroelectricity production need to consider factors affecting conservation and food production). With regard to the effects of climate change on the WEF Nexus, risk and stochastic elements must be considered when developing a science-based model for the sustainable management of WEF resources.","CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; DECISION-MAKING; TRADE-OFFS; SECURITY; CHALLENGES; POLICY; OPPORTUNITIES; IMPACT; PERSPECTIVE","Water-energy-food nexus; Climate change; Stochastic elements; Global risk; Sustainable development","STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT","Guerra, JBSOD##Berchin, II##Garcia, J##Neiva, SD##Jonck, AV##Faraco, RA##de Amorim, WS##Ribeiro, JMP","[de Andrade Guerra, Jose Baltazar Salgueirinho Osorio; Berchin, Issa Ibrahim; Garcia, Jessica; da Silva Neiva, Samara; Jonck, Ana Valquiria; Faraco, Rafael Avila; de Amorim, Wellyngton Silva; Ribeiro, Joao Marcelo Pereira] Univ Southern Santa Catarina Unisul, Ctr Sustainable Dev GREENS, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

ESD, understood as an integral part of quality education and all educational institutions, from preschool to higher education and in nonformal and informal education, can and should foster the development of sustainability competencies. This Special Issue entitled ""Competencies in Education for Sustainable Development"" responds to this urgency and the papers presented deliver recent developments in the field of ESD competencies. They focus on various perspectives: systematic literature reviews; curriculum developments; meta-analysis of the interrelation between sustainability content, competencies developed and pedagogical approaches used; testing and validation of evaluation tools and processes for sustainability competencies; and the development of conceptual models focused on different subject areas and educational levels (higher education, primary education, rural schools, external support services to schools, and extracurricular activities). The contributions indicate how the field of ESD competencies in the area of sustainability has become a major focus in recent years. Further research efforts need to be put into operationalizing sustainability competencies and developing tools to measure and evaluate students' and educators' competencies development.",NA,"competencies; education for sustainable development; evaluation; pedagogical approach; curriculum","SUSTAINABILITY","Cebrian, G##Junyent, M##Mula, I","[Cebrian, Gisela] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Pedag, Campus Sescelades, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain.

"J","WOS:000516863900003",2019,"Can multinational companies foster institutional change and sustainable development in emerging countries? A case study","Emerging countries present institutional necessities that hinder their sustainable development. In the face of this challenge, companies, and in particular multinational companies (MNCs), can foster sustainable development through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. This study focuses on the role of institutional change in transforming CSR into sustainable development in emerging countries. To this end, we propose a view of CSR focused on its institutional determinants and outcomes from a social and developmental perspective. By using quantitative and qualitative data, we analyse the case of three MNCs from different industries based in Europe and operating in Mexico. The case study shows how firms can stimulate institutional change in developing economies and contribute to their sustainable development as measured by the sustainable development goals. Various mechanisms about how this process is made are devised: institutional entrepreneurship, multistakeholder initiatives, interconnection of different institutional dimensions, and subsidiary entrepreneurship. The case study highlights the interaction among MNCs, developing countries, and institutions and how firms' sustainable actions scale up to the macro level.","CORPORATE-SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; POVERTY ALLEVIATION; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; MARKETS EVIDENCE; CSR; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; VOIDS; PERSPECTIVES","corporate social responsibility; institutional change; institutional necessities; Latin America; Mexico; sustainable development; sustainable development goals","BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT","Forcadell, FJ##Aracil, E","[Javier Forcadell, Francisco] ESIC Business & Mkt Sch, Madrid, Spain.

"J","WOS:000517298800011",2019,"Knowledge Management Impact on Sustainable Development","The modern world is changing rapidly, and one of the most important changes conditioning development is knowledge and awareness. This article analyses sustainable development as the main long-term link of society's development ideology towards knowledge management. It is stressed that knowledge, experiences, competences, civic liability motivate people to comply with the environmental, social, and economic sustainable development requirements. It has been noticed that one of the ways to study cognitive sustainable development dimension is thinking about development as a social process of learning, which on the individual level, helps people to control their personal experience of sustainable development by independently applying it to solve problems and create their future. On the organizational level, by applying knowledge management means and techniques, the intellectual knowledge of workers is transformed into sustainable competitive advantage of the organization. On the global level, the principles of sustainable development are applied when creating sustainable international community.",NA,"Knowledge management; intellectual capital; sustainable development","MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS","Mikalauskiene, A##Atkociuniene, Z","[Mikalauskiene, Asta; Atkociuniene, Zenona] Vilnius Univ, Fac Comunicat, Dept Informat & Knowledge Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.","Economics","Business & Economics","Adomaitiene J., 2006, PEDAGOGY, P15##AMIDON DM, 1998, J KNOWLEDGE MANAGEME, V2, P23##Auer T., 2004, WIV NEWSLETTER WIV NEWSLETTER##Ausra A., 2005, ROLE OPEN RESOURCES##Belas J, 2018, TRANSFORM BUS ECON, V17, P55##Bischoff S, 2011, ENABLING INNOVATION: INNOVATIVE CAPABILITY - GERMAN AND INTERNATIONAL VIEWS, P337, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-24503-9_34##Bontis N, 1999, INT J TECHNOL MANAGE, V18, P433, DOI 10.1504/IJTM.1999.002780##Byukusenge E, 2017, COGENT BUS MANAG, V4, DOI 10.1080/23311975.2017.1368434##Chakori S., 2017, INTERDISCIPLINARY J, V4##Ciegis R., 2005, TECHNOLOGICAL EC DEV, V11, P260##Ciegis R., 2007, ORG MANAGEMENT SYSTE, V44, P19##Ciegis R, 2008, TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO, V14, P29, DOI 10.3846/2029-0187.2008.14.29-37##Ciegis R, 2005, ENVIRONMENT, TECHNOLOGY, RESOURCES, PROCEEDINGS, P79##Cushman M., 2002, BRIT AC MAN C FAST T##Davenport T.

"J","WOS:000519135100041",2020,"Managing Sustainable Urban Tourism Development: The Case of Ljubljana","The interest in sustainable urban development and sustainable tourism development is growing. Yet, according to our knowledge, only a limited number of studies combining those two areas exist, and the holistic model for sustainable urban tourism development has not been introduced. Our study aims to integrate sustainable urban development scientific area with sustainable tourism development scientific area and to integrate and advance the existing models for sustainable urban tourism development. As a method for analyzing the results of 322 interviews, we used content analysis. Based on the analyzed data, the conceptual sustainable urban tourism model is proposed and applied to the case of Ljubljana. The results show that Ljubljana needs more emphasis on sustainable urban tourism development by considering different dimensions of sustainability, stakeholders, as well as types of tourism. Specifically, respondents took into consideration social, environmental, as well as economic sustainability. The most often mentioned stakeholders were local communities and companies; meanwhile, according to their opinion, Ljubljana has the greatest potential in cultural, green, and sports tourism. Finally, the study integrates sustainable urban development and sustainable tourism development scientific areas by providing a conceptual model and taking into consideration the need for proper management, ranging from planning to education and policy-making.","CULTURAL-HERITAGE; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; IMPACT; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; THINKING; CITY","sustainable urban tourism development model; content analysis; sustainable urban development; sustainable tourism development; management","SUSTAINABILITY","Grah, B##Dimovski, V##Peterlin, J","[Grah, Barbara; Dimovski, Vlado; Peterlin, Judita] Univ Ljubljana, Sch Econ & Business, Kongresni Trg 12, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Adiati MP, 2018, IOP C SER EARTH ENV, V126, DOI 10.1088/1755-1315/126/1/012063##Ahern J, 2013, LANDSCAPE ECOL, V28, P1203, DOI 10.1007/s10980-012-9799-z##[Anonymous], LJUBLJANA AGAIN MAKE##Ardoin NM, 2015, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V23, P838, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2015.1024258##Ashworth G, 2011, TOURISM MANAGE, V32, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2010.02.002##Serrato FB, 2019, CUAD TUR, P123, DOI 10.6018/turismo.43.05##Boes K, 2016, INT J TOUR CITIES, V2, P108, DOI 10.1108/IJTC-12-2015-0032##BROWN BJ, 1987, ENVIRON MANAGE, V11, P713, DOI 10.1007/BF01867238##Cabezas H, 2004, TECHNOLOGICAL CHOICES FOR SUSTAINABILITY, P37##Camagni R, 1998, INT J ENVIRON POLLUT, V10, P6, DOI 10.1504/IJEP.1998.002228##Cheng MM, 2016, INT J HOSP MANAG, V57, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhm.2016.06.003##Crnek D., 2019, P 1 SE EUR SMART SOC##Daft R.L., 2015, UNDERSTANDING MANAGE##Dahlya B., 2020, NEW URBAN AGENDA ASI, P3##Delmastro C, 2019, SMART CITY EMERGENCE: CASES FROM AROUND THE WORLD, P51, DOI 10.1016/B978-0-12-816169-2.00003-1##Dickinson JE, 2017, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V25, P163, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2016.1182538##Dodds R., 2007, Current Issues in Tourism, V10, P296, DOI 10.2167/cit278.0##Dodds R., 2003, Tourism (Zagreb), V51, P157##Edwards D, 2008, ANN TOURISM RES, V35, P1032, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2008.09.002##Egger S, 2006, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V21, P1235, DOI 10.1016/j.envsoft.2005.04.012##Eligh J, 2002, SUSTAIN DEV, V10, P223, DOI 10.1002/sd.195##Erdmenger E, 2019, Z TOUR, V11, P437, DOI 10.1515/tw-2019-0025##Espiner S, 2017, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V25, P1385, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2017.1281929##Estevao RSG, 2019, J CLEAN PROD, V236, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.318##European Comission, 2016 LJUBLJ##Fernandez-Robin C, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11133737##Girard LF, 2017, AESTIMUM, V70, P51, DOI 10.13128/Aestimum-21081##Goeldner C.

"J","WOS:000519135104027",2020,"Multi-Scale Evaluation of Suzhou City's Sustainable Development Level Based on the Sustainable Development Goals Framework","A sustainable development system involves resource limitation, environmental stress and policy regulation, and the flow and integration of resources and factors on a multi-level spatial scale. However, it is difficult to meet the actual needs of local development through traditional single-scale and macro-scale evaluation of the comprehensive level. Taking Suzhou City as an example, based on the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) framework, the entropy method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) were used to construct an evaluation index system of the municipal sustainable development level. Growth and obstacles of the sustainable development system and its subsystems were systematically analyzed on a multi-level spatial scale. Results show that during the study period (2000-2016), the sustainable development system in Suzhou was relatively low at the beginning of the study. With the passage of time, it generally developed in a stable, continuous, and balanced direction. The levels of development, deficiencies, and obstacle factors of sustainable development systems and their subsystems are significantly different between levels; especially during the study period, the order change between towns is significantly higher than the order change between districts. Within an evaluation unit, there is a process of rising and continuing growth among certain subsystems, but some subsystems have been developing slowly due to resource constraints, environmental load, etc., or their contribution to the level of sustainable development has remained low. The city sustainable development evaluation index system based on the SDGs framework can meet the requirements of regional assessment and has the potential for further promotion and use. The evaluation results can provide a necessary reference for the subsystem coordination, scale linkage, and resource space allocation of the sustainable development system in Suzhou.","CHINA; ENTROPY; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; SUPPORT; SYSTEMS; GROWTH","municipality; sustainable development; multi-scale; evaluation; Suzhou city","SUSTAINABILITY","Lin, WX##Hong, CQ##Zho, YK","[Lin, Weixing; Hong, Changqiao; Zho, Yinkang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000522460200015",2020,"How do Clusters Foster Sustainable Development? An Analysis of EU Policies","Sustainable development is one of the fundamental and most important objectives of the worldwide policy. The conducted research shows that sustainable development (SD) is increasingly important in the consciousness of the EU countries, which can be viewed through a prism of the undertaken projects. This paper raises the issue of clusters and their significance in the development of a sustainable economy. The article explores trends in the European Union policy related to sustainable development and clusters. The purpose of this study is to find an answer to the following questions: How can clusters contribute to sustainable development and what are the key factors that ensure this process? To achieve the goal of the article a systematic study of the literature and reports was carried out. Moreover, the analysis of the activity of European clusters in the context of sustainable development was performed. Next, the examples of cluster projects focused on sustainable development were presented. It was shown that the clusters contribute a smarter and sustainable development by succeeding in technological and scientific results, developing new technologies for emerging industries, creating new business activities, enticing major technology companies, and connecting local firms into world-class value systems. Furthermore, the clusters participate actively in sustainable development as they promote knowledge creation, joint learning, technology transfer, as well as collaboration, and sustainable innovations. Finally, clusters facilitate the sustainable upgrading of small and medium enterprises and encourage the participation of stakeholders in the process of sustainable development.","INNOVATION; ENVIRONMENT; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMY; CONTEXT","cluster; sustainable development; sustainable economy; SDG implementation","SUSTAINABILITY","Derlukiewicz, N##Mempel-Sniezyk, A##Mankowska, D##Dyjakon, A##Minta, S##Pilawka, T","[Derlukiewicz, Niki] Wroclaw Univ Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.

What has hardly been taken into account and investigated are the spatial requirements for a sustainable transition to this new system. In order to clarify this, bioeconomy related strategies and policy papers were analyzed thematically. It was shown that spatially relevant issues are addressed to very different extents. Some strategies have a clear technological and economic orientation, while other documents point to the importance of the regional and local levels and the use of spatial planning measures to successfully and sustainably implement a bioeconomy. Overall, the picture emerged that many strategies are still a long way from mainstreaming Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as set out by the United Nations.","STRATEGIES; EUROPE; ECONOMY","bioeconomy;

The review documented the size, growth trajectory and geographic distribution of this literature, identified high impact scholars and documents, and visualized the ""intellectual structure"" of the field. The database examined in this review consisted of 1842 English language, Scopus-indexed documents published between 1990 and 2018. The review found that the knowledge base on ESD has grown dramatically over the past 30 years, with a rapidly accelerating rate of publication in the past decade. Although the field has been dominated by scholarship from Anglo-American_European nations, there is evidence of increasing geographic diversification of the ESD knowledge base over the past 15 years. Citation analyses identified authors who have had a significant influence on the development of this literature. Author co-citation analysis revealed three ""schools of thought"" that comprise the ""intellectual structure"" of this knowledge base: Education for Sustainable Development, Developing a Sustainability Mindset, Teaching and Learning for Sustainability. Document content analyses led to the conclusion that the current knowledge base is heavily weighted towards critical, descriptive and prescriptive papers, with an insufficient body of analytical empirical studies.

"J","WOS:000523293400012",2020,"Sustainable management of human resources in enterprises as an example of sustainable development","The aim of the article is to present the essence of sustainable human resource management and attempt to answer the question of whether enterprises actually use the concept of the sustainable management of human resources in business management to achieve sustainable development. This is why the following research question was chosen for the study: ""Is the concept of sustainable human resource management important in achieving sustainable development of an enterprise?"" Verification of the research question and the realisation of the stated goal were made on the basis of a critical analysis of the source literature and a case study. In striving to achieve the research goal, the first part of the article presents the essence of sustainable human resource management; the second part presents a case study. This paper concludes with the applications in which the research question was confirmed. Enterprises choose a strategy for human resource management, depending on the following: the situation in the labour market, the economic situation, legal regulations, demographics, changes in technology in a given enterprise, the activities of both the employers' and employees' organisations, as well as self-governing bodies, employment agencies or personnel consulting firms and the capital owned by the organisation. The results of this study have shown that enterprises actually use the concept of the sustainable management of human resources in business management to achieve sustainable development.","PERFORMANCE","sustainable human resource management; HRM; sustainable development; sustainable development of enterprises; enterprises; management","SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS OF THE MARITIME UNIVERSITY OF SZCZECIN-ZESZYTY NAUKOWE AKADEMII MORSKIEJ W SZCZECINIE","Drela, K","[Drela, Karolina] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ Finance & Management, Inst Management, 8 Cukrowa, PL-71004 Szczecin, Poland.","Engineering, Marine","Engineering","Bombiak E, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11041044##Bossink B., 2012, ECOINNOVATION SUSTAI##Bowen H.R., 1953, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT##Cherian J., 2012, INT J BUSINESS MANAG, V7, P25, DOI [DOI 10.5539/IJBM.V7N21P25, 10.5539/ijbm.v7n21p25]##Cohen E., 2012, HRMS ROLE CORPORATE##Cohen S., 2011, SUSTAINABILITY MANAG##Czerna-Grygiel J., 2011, ZESZYTY NAUKOWE UNIW, P369##DRUCKER Peter, 1954, PRACTICE MANAGEMENT##Ehnert I, 2009, CONTRIB MANAG SCI, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-7908-2188-8##Epstein MJ, 2014, MAKING SUSTAINABILITY WORK: BEST PRACTICES IN MANAGING AND MEASURING CORPORATE SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS, 2ND EDITION, P1##Harmon J., 2010, PEOPLE STRATEGY, V33, P16##Haugen G., 2014, SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM##Hilarowicz A., 2015, ZESZYTY NAUKOWE POLI, V85, P141##Hilarowicz A., 2015, ZESZYTY NAUKOWE POLI, V79, P77##Iraldo F, 2009, J CLEAN PROD, V17, P1444, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.05.013##Jackson SE, 2011, Z PERSONALFORSCH, V25, P99, DOI 10.1688/1862-0000_ZfP_2011_02_Jackson##Jones M., 2010, SUSTAINABLE EVENT MA##Kramar R, 2014, INT J HUM RESOUR MAN, V25, P1069, DOI 10.1080/09585192.2013.816863##Mampra M., 2013, P 10 AIMS INT C MAN, P1273##Mazur B., 2015, EC MANAG, V7, P7, DOI [10.12846/j.em.2015.02.01, DOI 10.12846/J.EM.2015.02.01]##MullerChrist G, 2011, SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT: COPING WITH THE DILEMMAS OF RESOURCE-ORIENTED MANAGEMENT, P1##Pabian A., 2017, ZESZYTY NAUKOWE POLI, V28, P7##Pabian A., 2011, ZARZDZANIE ZASOBAMI, V5, P9##Pfeffer J, 2010, ACAD MANAGE PERSPECT, V24, P34, DOI 10.5465/AMP.2010.50304415##PKN, 2012, 260002012 PKN PNISO##Spreitzer G, 2012, ORGAN DYN, V41, P155, DOI 10.1016/j.orgdyn.2012.01.009##Thom N., 2004, PERSONALFUHRUNG, V7, P52##Truss C, 2013, INT J HUM RESOUR MAN, V24, P2657, DOI 10.1080/09585192.2013.798921##Ulrich D., 2009, PEOPLE STRATEGY VOL, V32, P24##Wyrzykowska B., 2017, STUDIA PRACE WYDZIAL, V48, P373##Zaugg R.J., 2001, SUSTAINABILITY HUMAN##Zoogah DB, 2011, Z PERSONALFORSCH, V25, P117, DOI 10.1688/1862-0000_ZfP_2011_02_Zoogah",2,"2021-09-03","[001/RID/2018/19];  [PLN 10,684,000.00]","COM9","no","SDG.12#SDG.9"

However, perceptions of sustainability are scale and place specific, and there has also been a call for Sustainable Development Goals and indicators that are more relevant for the Arctic than the global perspectives. Based on earlier and ongoing efforts to identify Arctic Social Indicators for monitoring human development, insights from scenario workshops and interviews at various locations in the Barents region and Greenland and on studies of adaptive capacity and resilience in the Arctic, we provide an exploratory assessment of the global SDGs and indicators from an Arctic perspective. We especially highlight a need for additional attention to demography, including outmigration; indigenous rights; Arctic-relevant measures of economic development; and social capital and institutions that can support adaptation and transformation in this rapidly changing region. Issues brought up by the SDG framework that need more attention in Arctic monitoring include gender, and food and energy security. We furthermore highlight a need for initiatives that can support bottom-up processes for identifying locally relevant indicators for sustainable development that could serve as a way to engage Arctic residents and other regional and local actors in shaping the future of the region and local communities, within a global sustainability context.","DEVELOPMENT GOALS; SYSTEMS","Arctic; polar regions; sustainable development; human development; SDGs; indicators","SUSTAINABILITY","Nilsson, AE##Larsen, JN","[Nilsson, Annika E.] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden.

Data from 36 OECD member countries for the period 1990-2017 have been obtained with the System-GMM method. According to the estimation results, the effect of biomass energy consumption on per capita sustainable development is positive and statistically significant whereas the effect of non-renewable energy on sustainable development is negative. According to this, the use of biomass energy sources in these countries causes the level of per capita sustainable development to rise. OECD countries should prefer biomass energy instead of non-renewable energy sources to reach the 2030 SDGs. Thus, this study shows the importance of biomass energy for sustainable development.","RENEWABLE ENERGY; CO2 EMISSIONS; NONRENEWABLE ENERGY; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; COUNTRIES; POLICY","Sustainable development; biomass energy; non-renewable energy; OECD; system-GMM","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Guney, T##Kantar, K","[Guney, Taner; Kantar, Kevser] Karamanoglu Mehmetbey Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Karaman, Turkey.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Aidt TS., 2010, 1061 CWPE##Alola AA, 2019, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V674, P307, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.163##Apergis N., 2014, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V4, P578##Apergis N, 2011, ENERGY SYST, V2, P299, DOI 10.1007/s12667-011-0037-6##ARELLANO M, 1991, REV ECON STUD, V58, P277, DOI 10.2307/2297968##ARELLANO M, 1995, J ECONOMETRICS, V68, P29, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01642-D##Aydin M, 2019, RENEW ENERG, V138, P620, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.001##Bao C, 2013, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V27, P464, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2013.07.008##Bilgili F, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V71, P830, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.109##Blundell R, 1998, J ECONOMETRICS, V87, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00009-8##BOZKURT C, 2015, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V5, P507##Busu M, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en12040578##Chen YL, 2019, RENEW ENERG, V131, P208, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2018.07.047##Chien TC, 2008, ENERG POLICY, V36, P3045, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2008.04.012##Danish, 2019, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V670, P1075, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.268##Dogan E, 2016, RENEW ENERG, V94, P429, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.078##Guney T., 2020, ENV PROG SUS EN UNPU##Guney T, 2019, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V26, P389, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2019.1595214##Guney T, 2017, J INT TRADE ECON DEV, V26, P316, DOI 10.1080/09638199.2016.1249391##Harris Jonathan M., 2003, INT SOC ECOLOGICAL E, V1, P1##Mahmood N, 2019, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V26, P21598, DOI 10.1007/s11356-019-05442-1##Maryam J, 2017, IOSR J HUMANITIES SO, V22, P53, DOI [10.9790/0837-2202055358, DOI 10.9790/0837-2202055358]##Ocal O., 2013, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V3, P193##Omri A, 2015, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V42, P1012, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2014.10.046##Ozturk I, 2011, APPL ENERG, V88, P2885, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.01.065##Pathak B, 2013, INT J ADV RES TECH, V2, P271##Saint Akadiri S, 2019, ENERG POLICY, V132, P803, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2019.06.040##Shafiei S, 2014, ENERG POLICY, V66, P547, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.064##Sinha A., 2015, INT J ENERGY EC POL, V5, P96##Soytas U, 2003, ENERG ECON, V25, P33, DOI 10.1016/S0140-9883(02)00009-9##Spaiser V, 2019, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V26, P282, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2018.1559252##Tamazian A, 2009, ENERG POLICY, V37, P246, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2008.08.025##Tugcu CT, 2012, ENERG ECON, V34, P1942, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2012.08.021##World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE",9,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM6","no","SDG.7"

This study contributes to existing knowledge about primary school teachers' approaches to ESD across a range of subjects. Norwegian schools can join the Sustainable Backpack programme (SBP), which supports teachers to develop projects that promote a holistic understanding of sustainable development across school subjects. The present study set out to examines teachers' interdisciplinary approach to ESD and the SBP teachers' perceptions of how their curriculum units promote environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development. The study is a multi-case study, with curriculum units designed for students aged 10-13 years from 14 Norwegian schools. Content analysis suggest that the units used several subjects to ESD, but the teachers could have challenged the students' reflection to a greater extent in terms of argumentation and critical thinking. The units succeeded to some extent in pursuing a holistic approach.","BOUND DIFFERENCES; DEVELOPMENT ESD; EDUCATION; ENVIRONMENT; BARRIERS; ISSUES","Curriculum units; primary school; interdisciplinarity; education for sustainable development","ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH","Munkebye, E##Scheie, E##Gabrielsen, A##Jordet, A##Misund, S##Nergard, T##Oyehaug, AB","[Munkebye, Eli] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Teacher Educ, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.

However, unplanned expansion has led to unequal access to those opportunities, especially for indigenous communities. Southern Andean communities continue to suffer from high rates of poverty and diseases. Work by the Cusco-based non-governmental organization Sierra Productiva has demonstrated that grassroots, people-focused sustainable development program can rectify many of these social ills by building capacity at the individual and community level while also promoting sustainable tourism. This article exploresSierra Productiva's cuy (guinea pig) farming operations in the Peruvian Andes outside Cusco to demonstrate how small-scale agricultural enterprises can create mutually beneficial relationships that promote cultural and ecological sustainability within the tourism sector without creating relationships of dependency. This example provides a model for sustainable tourism development that can provide a framework for other areas of tourism.","COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; AUTHENTICITY; ECONOMY; LIMITS","Sustainable tourism; sustainable development; mass tourism; economic sustainability; cultural tourism","TOURISM PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT","Westmont, VC","[Westmont, V.

The aim of the social enterprise is completely align with sustainable development goals (SDGs), which is to harness a better quality of life. In providing a further understanding of how social enterprise maps to SDGs, this study was conducted with two objectives; first is to reduce the SE measurement complexity by synthesising the triple bottom line approach, and second is to link the SE values to sustainable development goals. The results of the thematic review provide three significant outcomes: 1) SE imbalance measurement; 2) SE capabilities and relationship with governance, and partner support; 3) reaching to SDGs by investing in basic SE infrastructure development for the society.","PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; SYSTEMS; CORPORATION; COMMUNITIES; ORIENTATION; FORESTRY","sustainable development; sustainable development goals; SDGs; social enterprise; social enterprise success; quality of life","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Kassim, ES##Tajmi, TAM##Hairuddin, H##Ab Malik, AM##Tobi, SUM","[Kassim, Erne Suzila; Tajmi, Thareq Ariffin Mohd; Hairuddin, Hanitahaiza; Ab Malik, Ariff Md] Univ Teknol MARA Caw Selangor, Fac Business & Management, Kampus Puncak Alam, Puncak Alam 42300, Selangor, Malaysia.

China's State Council issued the Development Plan for China's Innovation Demonstration Zone for Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2016, which offered a Chinese prescription for global sustainable development. Implementation of the Plan is based on National Sustainable Development Pilot Zones (NSDPZs). This gives rise to the question of what adjustments are needed to promote the development of NSDPZs under the Plan's guidance. This study aims to analyze the current situation of NSDPZs and explore the research direction in the future. Based on the development situations of NSDPZs over the past 30 years, this study investigated their spatiotemporal distribution characteristics, related research progress, and existing problems. Moreover, proposals are made for the key tasks of NSDPZs according to the Plan's requirements in terms of the following: exploring the mechanism for integrating science and technology innovation with social undertakings, solving the bottleneck problem in regional sustainable development, exploring avenues for high-quality development, and promoting the coordinated development of NSDPZs in eastern, central, and western regions. This study can serve as a reference for relevant decision making and provide rich cases demonstrating China's approach to sustainable development.",NA,"China; pilot zones; spatiotemporal distribution; sustainable development; the 2030 Agenda","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL","Li, JL##Sun, PL##Gnu, Y##Sun, W##Song, HM##Hao, JQ","[Li, Junli; Sun, Piling; Gnu, Yu; Sun, Wei; Song, Huaming] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Tourism, 80 Yantai Rd, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China.

Local food producers share a common heritage because of the cultural and historical ties in their regions, while consumers tend to value food products produced locally. The purpose of this article was to explore market participants' attitudes toward the impact of local food product attributes on sustainable regional development. The authors' findings on the main advantages and barriers to consumption of local food products have pointed out the complexity of the relationships between market participants (i.e., producers and consumers) and indicated that a deeper understanding is necessary for overall economic development. The problems of local food products in Serbia, in the context of sustainable regional development, have not been investigated so far, and for this reason, it is important to analyze the differences between consumer and producer attitudes to reduce this perceived gap in the literature. In this way, these insights can offer opportunities for strategic actions in regard to the local food product supply and consumption, with the aim of including different regional stakeholders.","WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; CONSUMERS PERCEPTIONS; SYSTEMS; PREFERENCES; FARM; MANAGEMENT; SAFETY","sustainable regional development; local food products; producers; perceptions","SUSTAINABILITY","Cvijanovic, D##Ignjatijevic, S##Tankosic, JV##Cvijanovi, V","[Cvijanovic, Drago] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Tourism & Hotel Management, Vojvodanska St 5a, Vrnjacka Banja 36210, Serbia.

"J","WOS:000531558100350",2020,"Transfer for Sustainable Development at Higher Education Institutions-Untapped Potential for Education for Sustainable Development and for Societal Transformation","Higher education institutions (HEIs) are increasingly confronted with societal needs beyond research and teaching. These include sustainable development and technology transfer as well as the practical application of knowledge and ideas. Several HEIs already put sustainable development and transfer into practice. These practitioner-university partnerships comprise a broad range of actors, disciplines, topics, and formats. However, transfer activities that contribute to sustainable development in society still make up only a very small part of HEIs' activities. In response to calls from society as a whole, HEIs could combine transfer and sustainable development more systematically. In this article, we suggest a concept of transfer for sustainable development. The focus is on sustainability transfer in teaching. We used mixed methods for this conceptual work: exploratory workshops, expert interviews, and a case study of transfer in teaching. One of the results presented in this article is a working definition of sustainability transfer at HEIs. In addition, six characteristics for describing sustainability transfer in its various forms are formulated.

"J","WOS:000531843500001",2020,"Students' attitudes towards sustainable development in Serbia","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine university students' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development and towards the need for the implementation of education for sustainable development into the higher education system. To that end, the paper explores in a process-oriented focus which drivers and barriers are experienced as being the most important ones and how they relate to one another. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on the questionnaire for the evaluation of attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development. This instrument consists of 9 batteries with 83 items presented in the form of the five-point Likert scale. The questionnaire evaluated different aspects of respondents' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development, but students' attitudes in relation to the items from the following subscales will be presented for this paper: understanding the concept of sustainable development, position of sustainable development in the system of higher education, sources of information about sustainable development and entities responsible for sustainable development. The study sample consisted of students from the University of Novi Sad, specifically from the faculties with accredited programs in the field of humanities and technological sciences. Findings In general, students recognized the main determinants of sustainable development and they support an integral approach to sustainability, i.e. the need to include the knowledge, values and skills for sustainable development in the higher education programs. In addition, they identified a number of obstacles and the uncertainties of overcoming them. In this regard, the students did not recognize the responsibility of the higher education institutions as the key responsibility or their own responsibility in relation to sustainable development, which can be related to their feeling of marginalization and the doubt that their behaviour and decisions can influence the development of the local society, as well as the development of the society as a whole. On the other hand, the respondents acknowledged the role, the importance and the responsibility of the mass media in the process of developing the attitudes towards and opinions about the problems related to environmental protection and sustainable development. Practical implications The results of the study indicate the students' attitudes towards sustainable development, thus making the directions for higher education reform clearer and in line with the present needs for sustainable development in Serbia. The obtained results can serve as a recommendation to the governing structures, i.e. to the relevant ministries of education and environmental protection, as well as to the universities in terms of which direction their process of planning and creating paths of sustainability should take. This is particularly important in the case of the Republic of Serbia, which is currently in the process of joining the European Union and responding to the requirements set by the process of negotiation for Chapter 27 in terms of improving the strategic framework and plans for the education for sustainable development and building the capacities in response to climate change. On the other hand, linking the results of this research with the results of similar studies around the world contributes to the further enrichment of the scientific knowledge base in this field and confirms the need for stronger and united efforts on the path to a sustainable future. It is a fact that, regardless of the national, economic, socio-political and cultural context, there is a global lack of success in shaping a humane and sustainable relationship between man and nature. Therefore, the results of this research should be considered as an invitation for new research initiatives regarding the ways to support the positive attitudes of students towards the concept of sustainable development and to facilitate their further development in the educational process, as well as in other academic domains. Originality/value This research is inspired by the fact that, in the Balkan countries, education for sustainable development has not been extensively discussed within the scientific discourse on higher education for sustainable development. This is one of the first papers to provide data about students' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development and the need for its implementation in the higher education system in Serbia. The value of the paper lies in its potential to help understand the role that different drivers and barriers play in higher education for sustainable development.","HIGHER-EDUCATION; ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES; KEY COMPETENCES","Sustainable development; Students; Higher education; Attitudes","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Nikolic, V##Vukic, T##Maletaski, T##Andevski, M","[Nikolic, Vesna] Univ Nis, Fac Occupat Safety, Nish, Serbia.

"J","WOS:000533902000001",2020,"Cyclone shelters need sustainable development","Purpose The coastal zone of Bangladesh that is in the front line of the battle against climate change faced over 200 natural disasters in the past 40 years, and most of the disasters were cyclones. The inevitable cyclone shelter (CS), the backbone of disaster management (DM), provides short-term safety for the disaster victims in Bangladesh. This study aims to explore the community-based limitations and sustainable development features of CSs including the gender issues. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was carried out among 230 community people to identify the requirements and sustainable development features of CSs. A field visit was carried out in 23 CSs to capture its existing facilities. Key informant interviews were conducted in the office of Upazila Engineers to strengthen survey data. Findings This research found that the plan of CSs, quality of construction, capacity, facilities, entrance and exit, space allocation, management and policy were not capable enough to fulfill the needs and requirements of the community people. Due to lack of separate facilities, women and girls avoided shelters for fear of sexual and mental harassment in CSs, as they had experiences in the earlier events of cyclones. Insufficient facilities discourage community from using the shelters. Research limitations/implications Women and girls were shy to share their experience in CSs. The historical data were limited in the study area. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research presents the actual community-based outcome. During CCRIP training program, the authors met 3,625 community people, and participatory discussions were made to explore the participants' experiences and perceptions about the sustainable development of CSs. Practical implications South-Asian coastal zones are prone to natural, quasi-natural hazard and disasters, where shelters are required for protecting lives of community people during such disasters such as cyclones, storm surges, and floods. Therefore, this study can help in making sustainable development decisions in terms of constructing shelters in disaster-prone countries like Bangladesh. Social implications The outcomes of this investigation are useful for uplifting psychosocial status to protect lives during disasters such as cyclones, storm surges and floods and increase accessibility to shelters, and users will consider CSs as a social asset. In turn, the acceptability of CSs into community level are expected to be increased for combating against cyclones, storm surges, and floods. Originality/value This study introduces the bottom-up approach that refers to the community-based decision-making to identify the limitations and sustainable improvement of CSs. This research contributes to bridging the gaps between decision-makers and users of CSs. From the authors' field experience, it can be said that this is the first fieldwork regarding the objectives.","RESILIENCE","Limitations; Women; Sustainable development; Cyclone; Cyclone shelters; Storm surge","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT","Shahin, M##Billah, M##Islam, MM##Parvez, A##Zaman, AKMM","[Shahin, Md] Patuakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Disaster Resilience & Engn, Patuakhali, Bangladesh.

"J","WOS:000535598700292",2020,"Mapping the Sustainable Development Goals Relationships","Sustainable development addresses humanity's aspiration for a better life while observing the limitations imposed by nature. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim to foster the organizational operationalization and integration of sustainability and, therefore, to address the current and forthcoming stakeholder needs and ensure a better and sustainable future for all, balancing the economic, social, and environmental development. However, it is not entirely clear which are the mutual relationships among the 17 SDGs and this study aims to tackle this research gap. The results of the correlation confirm that Poverty elimination (SDG1) and Good health and well-being (SDG3) have synergetic relationships with most of the other goals. SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) has significant relationships with other SDGs (e.g., SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG13 (Climate action)). However, there is a moderate negative correlation with SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), which emphasizes the need to improve energy efficiency, increase the share of clean and renewable energies and improve sustainable consumption patterns worldwide. There is also confirmation that SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal strongly associated with trade-offs. To sum up, this research suggests that change towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals offers many opportunities for reinforcing rather than inhibiting itself. However, some SDGs show no significant correlation with other SDGs (e.g., SDG13 (Climate action) and SDG17 (Partnerships for the goals), which highlights the need for future research.","TRADE-OFFS; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; SYNERGIES; MATURITY; SDGS","sustainable development; sustainable development goals; relationships; synergies; trade-offs; correlation","SUSTAINABILITY","Fonseca, LM##Domingues, JP##Dima, AM","[Fonseca, Luis Miguel] Polytech Porto, Sch Engn Porto ISEP, Ctr Res & Dev Mech Engn CIDEM, P-4249015 Porto, Portugal.

"J","WOS:000535733200001",2020,"A study of development mode in green campus to realize the sustainable development goals","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on the way to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Through the introduction and learning of a specific case, this paper summarizes the specific process of green campus's development and construction and directly discusses how to achieve the goal of sustainable development. By analyzing the achievements and measures of its construction, on the one hand, the experience and shortcomings of its green campus construction are summarized; on the other hand, the impact of Stanford's own green campus construction on the local community is discussed. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes Stanford, one of the best green campuses assessed by sustainability tracking, assessment and rating system (STARS), as a case study in three steps. First, it introduces the academics, energy supply and demand, water and land, waste, management, food and living, buildings and transportation of its campus construction in detail; second, it uses the STARS to make a comprehensive sustainable evaluation of Stanford; finally, it discusses the development relationship between Stanford and local community. Findings The four characteristics of its green campus development model are summarized, namely, based on its own scientific research; from the aspect of environmental friendliness; to achieve joint participation; and forming complementary development with the community. The construction of green campus has changed from a single triangle framework composed of SDGs, STARS and universities to a compound triangle framework composed of SDGs, universities and communities on the existing basis, greatly expanding the way to realize SDGs. Practical implications This development mode will have direct guiding significance for the sustainable construction of other campuses. Social implications This paper also discusses the development concept from green campus to sustainable community to provide positive reference to achieve the global SDGs from the perspective of colleges and universities. Originality/value According to the historical track of its development, this paper combines the two (SDGs and green campus) to discuss by using campus construction as an effective way to achieve the SDGs. On the basis of literature research and case study, STARS sustainable assessment is introduced. This will lead to quantitative analysis of sustainable construction in the discussion of the specific case, judging the specific sustainable degree of all aspects of campus construction, to provide a scientific basis for summarizing its characteristics of development mode.",NA,"Green campus; Sustainable development goals; STARS assessment; Sustainable community; Development mode","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Zhu, BF##Zhu, CF##Dewancker, B","[Zhu, Bifeng; Zhu, Chufan] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, Zhijiang Coll, Keqiao, Peoples R China.

Design/methodology/approach This study employed a sample of Chinese firms from 2008-2015 and conducted regression analysis to explore the motivations behind corporate philanthropy. Findings Philanthropic giving is positively and significantly related to all indicators of firm performance; the interaction term of controversial industries and philanthropic giving is also positively and significantly related to firm performance. The empirical evidence supports the social impact hypothesis. Practical implications The empirical evidence shows that firms engage in philanthropic giving, mainly in pursuit of their own interests. Hence, managers should consider the inherent characteristics of the company and then combine social interests with their economic interests to design a philanthropic strategy of their own, which can in turn contribute to sustainable development. Originality/value This paper empirically confirms that the social impact hypothesis holds for the philanthropic activities of Chinese firms.

The UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development is all-inclusive, where every contribution is valid. Participation, partnerships, education, sustainable living and global citizenship, all of which can build on Citizen Science activities, are crucial for the Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, this study aims at exploring several collaboration channels for Citizen Science-related activities and the Agenda 2030. Challenges and critical aspects are discussed based on the opinions of practitioners collected through a comprehensive online survey. Furthermore, recommendations for future involvement are given on a framework of interactions at different levels for Citizen Science and the Agenda 2030. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the same states seem to prioritize certain SDGs in national implementation. Such cherry-picking defies the ""integrated and indivisible"" nature of the SDGs, and could negatively impact overall progress on sustainable development globally. Which SDGs receive more attention than the others in national policies, and what implications can we draw for global governance? We address these questions in two parts. Through a content analysis of the Voluntary National Reviews of 19 countries of varying income levels, we find that SDGs 1 and 8 on poverty eradication and economic growth are by far most widely prioritized. We then look specifically into Bhutan and Vietnam to explore possible explanations for goal prioritization as well as the potential steering effects of international organizations on their national policies. The findings have important policy implications for global governance. We argue that the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, in particular, has an important role to play to better coordinate international organizations to help mitigate unhealthy goal prioritization.","TRADE-OFFS; SDGS; PATHWAYS; POLICY","cherry-picking; governance through goals; international organizations; prioritization; Sustainable Development Goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Forestier, O##Kim, RE","[Forestier, Oana; Kim, Rakhyun E.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","Abbott K.

However, what if the goals of sustainable development would not be achieved to 2030? What other way we can identify for humanity to survive? So, the study is about the problems of studying the understanding of the term "" sustainable development"", considering the evolution of the formation of the concept of sustainable development and analyzing the modern goals of sustainable development for attainability. From an analysis of domestic and foreign experience, possible scenarios of the development of mankind are identified (such as 1. Creating an environmental framework, 2. Implementation of sustainable nature management practices in the conditions of natural and man-made objects, 3. Implementation of ""geoengineering projects"", 4. Construction of autonomous ecosystems, 5. Space exploration in search of a new planet for life, provided that the goals of sustainable development would not be achieved. It has been established that today probability of achieving all the sustainable development goals by 2030 is too small, and the indicated scenarios require, firstly, the development of science and technology, and secondly, a competent assessment of the value of nature and solving the issue of specifying property rights for natural goods.",NA,"scenario approach; ecological framework; geoengineering projects; autonomous ecosystems; sustainable nature management; space exploration; sustainable development goals","JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE","Yurak, VV##Dushin, AV##Mochalova, LA","[Yurak, Vera V.; Dushin, Alexey, V; Mochalova, Lyudmila A.] Ural State Min Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.","Mining & Mineral Processing","Mining & Mineral Processing","Akimova T.A., 2006, ECOLOGY MAN EC BIOTA, P495##[Anonymous], RUSSIA AWAITS LUXEMB##Costanaza R., 2019, SUSTAINABLE EC##Costanza R, 2014, NATURE, V505, P283, DOI 10.1038/505283a##Danilov-Danilyan V I, 2000, EKOLOGICHESKIY VYZOV, P416##Duraiappah AK, 2012, ENVIRON DEV ECON, V17, P362, DOI 10.1017/S1355770X12000150##Environmental protection in Russia, 2016, 2016 STAT CBORN, P88##GORSHKOV V G, 1980, Botanicheskii Zhurnal (St. Petersburg), V65, P1579##Gorshkov V.G., 1998, T MEZHDUNARODNOGO SE, P3##Gorshkov V.G., 1995, PHYS BIOL FDN LIFE, P472##Gorshkov V.G., 1996, VESTNIK RAN, P802##Ignateva M.N., 2018, SBORNIK NAUCHNYKH ST, P211##Ignateva M.N., 2019, STRATEGIES TOOLS ENV, P358##Kasparian J, 2012, J APPL STAT, V39, P2223, DOI 10.1080/02664763.2012.706265##Khovavko I., 2018, EHKONOMIST, P31##Kochurov B.

"J","WOS:000541711100001",2020,"A system thinking approach for harmonizing smart and sustainable city initiatives with United Nations sustainable development goals","Technology has indispensably been a part of the city evolution throughout history. In recent years, there has been a shift in the pattern of development in smart cities, where smart cities attempt to embrace practices of sustainability using Information and Communication Technologies and other smart solutions. Past studies reveal that these smart cities have failed in successfully incorporating sustainable development goals into their smart strategies, where they tend to focus more on achieving smartness goals rather than sustainability goals and targets. This paper presents a multi-faceted interrogative study on several ongoing smart city initiatives around the globe that supports United Nations Urban Sustainability Agenda. This paper aims to focus on harmonizing smart and sustainable city initiatives with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals using a systems thinking approach. The study develops conceptual models that support the city transition into being a sustainable smart city. These conceptual models were designed based on the fundamentals of system thinking for a system of several elements under the key catalyzers ""Policy and Governance,"" ""Research & Development,"" and ""Partnership."" The causalities and interrelationships among elements in developed conceptual models justify the dynamicity and the impact of these elements within a system. The outcome of this research paper would support industry experts, policymakers, and city planners to adopt robust policy interventions and best practices for developing strategies that support the transition of smart cities to the futuristic label of sustainable cities.","CITIES; INDUSTRY; IMPACT","smart city initiatives; sustainable smart City; systems thinking; United Nations sustainable development goals; United Nations urban sustainability agenda","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Kutty, AA##Abdella, GM##Kucukvar, M##Onat, NC##Bulu, M","[Kutty, Adeeb A.; Abdella, Galal M.; Kucukvar, Murat] Qatar Univ, Coll Engn, Mech & Ind Engn, Doha, Qatar.

"J","WOS:000543421400113",2020,"Guidelines for Operationalizing Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) as a Methodology for the Design and Implementation of Sustainable Development Strategies","Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) is considered a pillar of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. It aims to promote whole of government approaches to sustainable development. Despite its prominence in development cooperation discussions, many national development professionals or stakeholders have not heard of PCD, indicating that its effectiveness is significantly limited. This article contends that the impact of PCD has not been maximized because it has been presented as a political objective or a policy tool by multilateral organizations and their member states. Instead, the article argues that PCD should be implemented as a methodology that can be adopted by domestic government and non-governmental actors alike, in order to understand trade-offs and co-benefits within and between policy sectors, thus promoting a participative approach. I-GAMMA is a research project in Mexico that examines data-driven public policy in order to promote PCD. It is based on in-depth reviews of policy documents and interviews with development actors. It is committed to open data, evidence-based policymaking, and collaborative dialogue between academics, government officials, and representatives of civil society organizations in sustainable development discussions. In the results section of this article, the project proposes participative PCD as a methodology for policy analysis through which a plurality of actors can identify mechanisms that either reinforce or undermine sustainable development strategies. This section then applies the methodology to the governance of protected natural areas in Mexico. The discussion section and the conclusions highlight the relevance of this approach for participative policymaking in sustainable development.","DEVELOPMENT GOALS; INTEGRATION","policy coherence for development; protected natural areas; public policy; social participation; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goals; Mexico","SUSTAINABILITY","Koff, H##Challenger, A##Portillo, I","[Koff, Harlan] Univ Luxembourg, Maison Sci Humaines, Dept Geog & Spatial Planning, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Belval, Luxembourg.

"J","WOS:000544479600005",2020,"Ecopedagogy: teaching critical literacies of 'development', 'sustainability', and 'sustainable development'","Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) largely emerged from Environmental Education (EE) models to teach how actions for 'development' positively and negatively affects our societies and the rest of nature, to then determine how such actions can be 'sustainable' without causing current or future socio-environmental oppressions. However, the 'development' has been increasingly taught as adhering to normalized neoliberal ideologies. This article provides a critical analysis of reinventing environmental pedagogies to center the 'reading' of development framings through the following questions: 'What is development?', 'Who is it for?', and 'What are the politics behind it?' Emergent from two research projects, centering the teaching of critical literacies (i.e. ecopedagogical literacies) to read 'development' and 'sustainability' was found essential in higher education. Rooted in critical theories and Freirean popular education movements in Latin American, ecopedagogy is transformative teaching in which educators dialectically problem-pose the politics of socio-environmental connections through local, global, and planetary lenses.","ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION; DEVELOPMENT ESD; CITIZENSHIP; GLOBALIZATION","Ecopedagogy; development; education for sustainable development; critical literacy; Paulo Freire","TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION","Misiaszek, GW","[Misiaszek, Greg William] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Theories Educ, Fac Educ, 19 Xinjiekou Wai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000544512000013",2020,"Tourism, sustainable development and the theoretical divide: 20 years on","A conceptual paper published twenty years ago concluded that sustainable tourism development is an unviable objective. Specifically, it argued that environmentally sound tourism development (sustainable tourism) is essential; sustainable development through tourism, however, is unachievable. Despite continuing alignment between tourism and sustainable development in both academic and policy circles, not only have the intervening two decades proved this argument in practice to be correct, but also there is little evidence of a more sustainable tourism sector. This paper, therefore, returns to the theoretical relationship between tourism and sustainable development, considering more recent transformations in understandings of the concept of development as well as contemporary approaches to sustainable development. Highlighting the controversy surrounding the continuing adherence to economic growth in development policy in general and tourism development in particular, it discusses sustainable de-growth as an alternative approach to development and, in the context of increasing concerns over climate change, the specific implications for tourism.","GROWTH; CAPITALISM; IMPACT; WORLD; GO","Sustainable tourism; sustainable development; economic growth model; sustainable de-growth","JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM","Sharpley, R","[Sharpley, Richard] Univ Cent Lancashire, Lancashire Sch Business & Enterprise, Greenbank Bldg, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics","Adelman S, 2018, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS: LAW, THEORY AND IMPLEMENTATION, P15##Alexis P., 2017, OVIDIUS U ANN EC SCI, V17, P288##Andriotis K., 2018, DEGROWTH TOURISM CON##Arain AR, 2020, ADV ORTHOP, V2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/1852025##Bellu L.G., 2011, DEV DEV PARADIGMS RE##Bramwell B, 2017, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V25, P1, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2017.1251689##Buckley R, 2012, ANN TOURISM RES, V39, P528, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2012.02.003##Butler MG, 1998, NY TIMES BK REV, P25##Cowen M., 1996, DOCTRINES DEV##CROALL J, 1995, PRESERVE DESTROY TOU##Cronin L., 1990, World Leisure & Recreation, V32, P12##Daly H., 1990, ECOL ECON, V2, P1##Dodds R., 2019, OVERTOURISM ISSUES R##Du Pisani J.A., 2006, ENV SCI, V3, P83, DOI [10.1080/15693430600688831, DOI 10.1080/15693430600688831]##Eagles P.

Official SDG indicators have been intensively developed, and they have a prominent and pronounced role as a key monitoring and policy instrument. Furthermore, various complementary or alternative indicator sets have been introduced at the global, regional and national levels. This article focuses on the risks related to the national indicators. The analysis is based on experiences from the preparation processes of sustainable development indicators in Finland and insights from indicator professionals and stakeholders in Finland and Germany. The risks related to overuse, nonuse and misuse of indicators are analyzed from the perspectives of indicator contents, processes of production and communication and external context factors. Opportunities for avoiding different risks and improving the desired societal impacts and influences of indicator usage are discussed. The concept of risk is helpful in terms of empirical diagnosis and for formulating mitigation recommendations.","CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS; KNOWLEDGE; EU","agenda 2030; Finland; indicators; risks; sustainability; sustainable development goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Lyytimaki, J##Salo, H##Lepenies, R##Buttner, L##Mustajoki, J","[Lyytimaki, Jari] Finnish Environm Inst, Environm Policy Ctr, Helsinki, Finland.

The role of sustainable innovation and environment is also examined. For this purpose, data were gathered by using a questionnaire survey. Questionnaires were distributed among the employees of universities in Poland. In addition, cluster sampling was used for data collection. For data analysis, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used through Partial Least Square (PLS). Results of the study revealed that sustainable HR and corporate entrepreneurship has significant role to enhance university sustainability through sustainable innovation. It is found that sustainable HR and corporate entrepreneurship has positive effect on sustainable innovation which leads to the sustainable university development. Moreover, working environment among the universities also has important role to enhance university sustainability through sustainable innovation activities. The study findings have significance for policy-makers as it clearly emphasizes on sustainable HR and organizational entrepreneurship's critical role in the successful implementation of innovation activities to enhance sustainable university development.","MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION","sustainable university development; sustainable HR; corporate entrepreneurship; sustainable innovation; environment","AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC","Grabara, J##Hussain, HI##Szajt, M","[Grabara, Janusz; Szajt, Marek] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Czestochowa, Poland.

This article reports the results of three case studies about sustainable education using e-learning technologies, where the focus of the analysis is on the need for sustainable and participatory development processes. The research approach is based on a meta-synthesis of three cases that target capacity-building in Maritime Education and Training using modern digital technologies. The result of the analysis is an analytical framework that describes how sustainable development of education needs to be understood as a participatory process of education and technology knowledge development taking place in layers of (1) standards, (2) applications, and (3) in-situ development, and based on an evolutionary and participatory process. The analytical framework contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between education for sustainability and sustainability of education-a relation that is recognized to be of importance, but that is also recognized as not sufficiently conceptualized. As the empirical research in this article evidences, a better understanding of sustainable development processes is of academic as well as practical relevance to build educational capacity using E-Learning technologies.","DESIGN; BODY","Sustainable development; E-learning; Education technologies; Participatory processes; Participatory design; Infrastructuring","ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT","Bolmsten, J##Manuel, ME","[Bolmsten, Johan] World Maritime Univ, Maritime Educ & Training Programme, Malmo, Sweden.

A panel data model is estimated using both random-effect and fixed-effect approaches. The Hausman test points to the superiority of the random-effect model over the fixed-effect model, which is apparent when the results of the two estimations are compared. The results of the random-effect estimation show a more significant and better overall fit. These results indicate a positive and significant effect of per capita income and financial development on sustainable development and a negative and significant effect of the inflation rate, natural resource rent, and time. The results suggest that maintaining a proper natural resource balance is necessary for sustainable development.","GENUINE SAVINGS; INDICATOR","adjusted net saving; natural resources rent; sustainable development","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Koirala, BS##Pradhan, G","[Koirala, Bishwa S.] Univ North Carolina Pembroke, Dept Econ & Decis Sci, One Univ Dr, Pembroke, NC 28372 USA.

The company can effectively confront the new challenges by attracting highly qualified employees for whom a high level of safety is important. Therefore, an important direction of sustainable business development is to increase the level of safety and create a comfortable working environment and optimize working processes to increase the efficiency of production activities, as well as prepare for the challenges that may arise in the process of company development. The article analyzes the statistics and structure of the socio-economic damage to business due to unsatisfactory working conditions and a high level of injuries on the example of the machine-building sector, and also considers aspects of maintenance of labor resources and ways to involve additional labor resources to ensure sustainable manufacturing development. Based on conducted analysis, an algorithm of implementation of managerial decisions was developed, aimed at ensuring the safety of personnel who carry out the work activities at the workplace, taking into account the modern concept of the ""green workplace"".

"J","WOS:000548372100004",2020,"Conceptual and Legal Framework for Promotion of Education for Sustainable Development: Case Study for Ukraine","Promoting the sustainable development is currently a key global issue posing a challenge to all of us on personal, professional and political levels. The education plays a major role in this path, in particular the education for sustainable development (ESD). The traditional one-way transfer of knowledge is no longer sufficient to inspire the students to behave as responsible citizens. This article suggests a number of competencies, which must serve as a basis for ESD, as well as application of the multiple intelligence theory as a mechanism for implementing the competencies derived by students from ESD at the basic education level. It is proved that security competencies in the broadest sense (covering all levels, from personal to the global space) should also be included in the modern educational process. As for the university education, it is required to explain the concept of ""sustainability"" to all specialties without exception, including the political scientists, engineers and others. This is particularly important for training of experts dealing with the economic law issues. A lack of economic analysis in modern legal studies and development of regulations results in writing and adoption of idle laws hazardous for the country. To upgrade the education system in Ukraine, it is appropriate to develop the National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development and its implementation plan based on the global Sustainable Development Goals. It is required to switch from traditional education to the model focused on sustainable development with the underlying extensive interdisciplinary knowledge based on an integrated approach to the development of society, economy, and environment. Implementation of this strategy should consider the adaptive nature of the regional education component, in particular the economic features of a relevant region. It is important to focus on the learning processes underlying the circular economy.","COMPETENCES","sustainable development; society; economy; environment; circular economy; education for sustainable development; sustainability; economic law","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Tetiana, H##Malolitneva, V","[Tetiana, Hudima; Malolitneva, Vesta] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Econ & Legal Res, Kiev, Ukraine.","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Barth M., 2007, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V8, P416, DOI [10.1108/1467637071082358, DOI 10.1108/14676370710823582, 10.1108/14676370710823582]##Barth M., 2007, GESTALTUNGSKOMPETENZ##Cebrian G, 2015, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V7, P2768, DOI 10.3390/su7032768##Doroshkevych A.S., 2012, SUSPILSTVO SPOZHYVAN##Gardner H., 2017, STRUKTURA RAZUMA TEO, V512, P3##Haan G., 2002, UMWELTKOMMUNIKATION, P259##Harenberg D., 2001, UMWELTBILDUNG NACHHA, V1##Hirsch J., 2016, SUSTAIN J REC, V9, P121, DOI [10.1089/sus.2016.29054, DOI 10.1089/SUS.2016.29054.HG, DOI 10.1089/SUS.2016.29054.hg]##Mochizuki Y, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P391, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077603##Paryz ' ka uhoda, 2015, PAR UH MIZHN DOK##Petrakov Y., BRYTANSKI UNIVERSYTE##Podger DM, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P339, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077568##Reid A, 2011, CHALLENGES FOR EUROPEAN INNOVATION POLICY: COHESION AND EXCELLENCE FROM A SCHUMPETERIAN PERSPECTIVE, P112##Summers M., 2005, ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCAT, V11, P623, DOI DOI 10.1080/13504620500169841##The Ministry of Environmental Protection of Republic of Croatia, 2011, ACT PLAN ED SUST DEV##Tsili, 2016, TSIL STAL ROZV 2016##UNESCO, 2014, UNESCO ROADM IMPL GL##UNESCO, 2018, ISSUES TRENDS ED SUS##UNESCO, 2018, GLOB ACT PROGR ED SU##Ursul A.D., 2016, SOTSIODINAMIKA, V2016, P1, DOI DOI 10.7256/2409-7144.2016.4.18218##Vare P., 2019, SUSTAINABILITY, V2019, P11##Waltner E.M., 2019, SUSTAINABILITY, V2019, P11##Wiek A, 2011, SUSTAIN SCI, V6, P203, DOI 10.1007/s11625-011-0132-6##Wilhelm S., 2019, SUSTAINABILITY, V2019, P11",0,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM8","no","SDG.4#SDG.8"

Water was the motivating theme. The priority of a fair distribution of water, guaranteeing the consumption, in quality and quantity, to all mankind and living beings is urgent. To respond to water-related sustainability challenges, people worldwide need to acquire ""water literacy"" about various aspects of water use and management in order to ensure safer water consumption and to contribute to Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). Three case studies were carried out in schools in three African countries: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique. A model of skills in education for sustainable development was applied (Sleurs, 2008). From the analysis of these case studies the theoretical assumptions of research were strengthened by the effective professional practice. But, on contrary, the results that the pillars of sustainable development presented in the basic research should be reviewed, placing the political dimension as transversal, thus strengthening education for sustainable development as fundamental for critical and responsible citizens of the present and of the future.

The purpose of the article is to classify institutions funding sustainable development initiatives and to study their experience at the European and national levels. Methodology / approach. As a meaningful methodological basis for the classification of the multilevel system of institutions, funding sustainable development initiatives, the multistakeholder approach is used and as a technical tool - typology method. Application of these methods, along with comparative analysis, allowed to generalize the experience of organizing institutional support for financing sustainable development initiatives at European and national level. Results. In the world and the EU there is a significant number of institutions, which in their totality create institutional support for the financing of sustainable development, which determines the importance of their classification. Based on a comparison of European and national experience, it has been determined that the formation of a national strategy for sustainable development in Ukraine needs to strengthen the institutional capacity to finance activities and objectives in this area. Originality / scientific novelty. The system of criterions for the development of standards, regulators, international organizations, which forms the institutional support for the financing of sustainable development based on the multistakeholder approach, has been developed. Practical value / implications. The specified system of criterions allows to streamline the process of defining a conceptual framework for financing sustainable development initiatives, taking into account the institutional and regulatory environment and the prevailing interests of stakeholders.",NA,"sustainable development financing; institutional support; goals of sustainable development; institute","AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC E-JOURNAL","Makarenko, I##Serpeninova, Y##Pogorila, K","[Makarenko, Inna; Serpeninova, Yulia; Pogorila, Kateryna] Sumy State Univ, Sumy, Sumy Oblast, Ukraine.","Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics","Agriculture; Business & Economics","[Anonymous], 2015, UN GLOBAL SUSTAINABL##[Anonymous], 2014, DEV COUNTRIES FACE 2##Backstrand K., 2006, European Environment, V16, P290, DOI 10.1002/eet.425##Brunhubber S, 2015, CADMUS, V2, P112##Brunnhuber S., 2017, 128 GLO##Busch T, 2016, BUS SOC, V55, P303, DOI 10.1177/0007650315570701##Ellen MacArthur Foundation SUN and McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, 2015, GROWTH CIRCULAR EC V##Griggs D, 2013, NATURE, V495, P305, DOI 10.1038/495305a##Hemmati M., 2002, MULTI STAKEHOLDER PR##Janicka M, 2016, COMP ECON RES, V19, P27, DOI 10.1515/cer-2016-0011##Jeucken Marcel, 2001, SUSTAINABLE FINANCE##Kozhuhova T.

Two major dimensions of financial development are considered: liquid liabilities and stock market capitalization. The empirical results revealed that financial development reduces income inequality only in countries where their GDP per capita is above ~US$11,000. It has no significant impact in reducing inequality in developing countries. This implies that institutional reforms in less developed and developing countries are necessary in order to reap the gains from financial development. Trade liberalization is found to have a positive impact on income inequality for both country groups-that is, trade benefits have worsened the income distribution.","ECONOMIC-GROWTH; FAIR-TRADE; INEQUALITY; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; WORLD","economic growth; financial development; income inequality; sustainable development; trade liberalization","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Gharleghi, B##Jahanshahi, AA","[Gharleghi, Behrooz] Univ Catolica Angeles Chimbote, Inst Invest, Chimbote, Peru.

"J","WOS:000555910700001",2020,"Romania's South-Muntenia Region, towards Sustainable Regional Development. Implications for Regional Development Strategies","Currently, at the end of the programming period 2014-2020 and in the view of the new programming exercise, 2021-2027, knowing where South-Muntenia is positioned on the path to sustainable regional development and how the main determinants can be integrated in regional development policies in order to continuously support the development of the Romanian regions becomes even more important. In this context, the paper aims to evaluate the progress made by the South-Muntenia region towards sustainable regional development for the period 2010-2017 highlighting the main implications for regional development strategies and revealing local initiatives promoting broader sustainable regional development. Thus, more in depth, the paper aims to identify the main determinants of sustainable regional development at the level of South-Muntenia counties using multiple principal component analysis (MPCA), to build an advancement sustainable development index based on panel data for the period 2010-2017 and to reveal the main sustainable development poles at the county level for the year 2017 using hierarchical clustering technique. The empirical results revealed the importance of business environment, public services infrastructure, education, and social protection as main determinants of South-Muntenia sustainable regional development. The advancement composite index pointed out that South-Muntenia recorded a slow but continuous advancement in terms of sustainable regional development, almost doubling its performance in these seven years. At the county level, if Prahova, Arges, and Dambovita exhibited a so-called stagnation, Ialomita and Teleorman were still behind, registering an advancement over the period but remained only halfway on the path to sustainable development, while Calarasi and Giurgiu tried to recover the huge gap, registering very low rates of sustainable development index. On the path to regional economic development, the relevance of two main sustainable regional development drivers can be highlighted-a better allocation for active measures with the reduction of unemployment as a target together with a better infrastructure of public services. National, regional, and local administrations play an important role in promoting sustainability in the economic, social, and environmental activities, in a coherent manner. Regardless of the level at which development policies are designed, local, county, or regional, they must take into account and monitor the sustainable development determinants if the ultimate goal is the overall regional development of South-Muntenia.","TOTAL WATER FOOTPRINT; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; CONSUMPTION; INDICATORS; GROWTH","sustainable regional development; regional development strategies; Romania; South-Muntenia region; multiple principal component analysis; cluster analysis; panel data analysis; advancement sustainable development index","SUSTAINABILITY","Davidescu, AA##Apostu, SA##Pantilie, AM##Amzuica, BF","[Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria; Apostu, Simona Andreea] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest 010552, Romania.

At the same time, rising populist movements increasingly influence the political debate in many countries by challenging multilateral cooperation and liberal democracy. This paper contains the first empirical study of the relationship between the SDGs and populism. In order to analyse the nexus between these growingly important concepts, we introduce a new ""Sustainability-Populism Framework"". It allows us to asses how the performance on the 17 SDGs over time relates to electoral support for populist parties, resulting in a classification of 39 countries into four categories. Moreover, in a regression analysis, we find that for each 1-point increase on the aggregate SDG Index (out of 100) over time, the vote share of populist parties on average drops by about 2 percentage points. Our results lend some support to the notion that a strong commitment to the SDGs (overall, as well as in particular to SDGs 1, 2, 11 and 15) could be part of an appropriate and effective answer to populism.

A policy perspective","Sustainable development seeks human well-being without stretching the ecological limits. It is assumed that if sustainable development is aspired at global level, the goals prescribed should be within the planetary limits. A comparison of the scores of countries with respect to Sustainable Development Goal Index (SDGI) and scores on ecological footprints (EF) portrays quite a grim picture where countries with high EF have attained high scores on SDGI. A further investigation into the causal relationship between SDGI, Human Development Index (HDI) and EF reveals that SDGs are being achieved in an unsustainable manner. The environmental policy perspective of the total, direct and indirect effects of EF on SDGs estimated through path analysis unveils that the existing mode of achieving SDGs is at the cost of environmental degradation. SDGs have shown improvement through the improvement in the level of HDI, where human development is being attained in an environmentally unsustainable manner. The paper establishes that SDGs achieved are ecologically unjustifiable, and a reorientation of the existing patterns of human development well within the limits of ecological capacity of the earth is to be targeted.",NA,"ecological footprint; environmental policy; Human Development Index; policy perspectives; sustainable development; sustainable development goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Jain, P##Jain, P","[Jain, Prerna] Jaipuria Inst Management, Dept Econ, 1 Bambala Inst Area, Jaipur 302033, Rajasthan, India.

In addition to economic benefits that flow from cultural and creative industries, the aforementioned contribute to resolving issues of sustainable urban development, as well as contributing to the 2030 Agenda, which is the main initiative of the United Nations. Although it is acknowledged by scholars that creativity promotes inclusive social progress and empowers people to take responsibility for their own economic, social and personal development and encourages innovation, which contributes significantly to sustainable growth, there is lack of empirically tested results. The article aims to analyse the linkages between the implementation of sustainable development goals achieved by countries, and the development of the creative economy in such countries. The empirical data were collected for comparison of creativity and sustainability indexes by reference to the case study of the Baltic States. Policy implications were provided based on the research conducted. The study found that Estonia is the best performing country in terms of measures of creativity and assessments of that country's creative economy. Furthermore, Estonia is the most sustainable country, and has achieved the greatest progress in implementing sustainable development goals of any of the Baltic States. All of the environmental indicators for Latvia, and taking into account Lithuania's economic indicators place these two countries at the same level in terms of sustainability. Highlights The linkages between sustainable development and creative economy analysed; Creativity and sustainability indexes are critically discussed; The creativity and sustainability indexes were compared in the case study for Baltic States; Policy implications were provided based on the research conducted.","CULTURE; URBAN; GROWTH; CITY","creative economy; creative economy indexes; SDGs; sustainability indexes; sustainable development","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Streimikiene, D##Kacerauskas, T","[Streimikiene, Dalia] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Sustainable Management Nat Resources & Environm R, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Circulation degree and sustainable development degree (SDD) are combined to the previous 3E system evaluation system to construct the integrated sustainable development evaluation model. This model realizes the accurate evaluation of different dimensions of 3E system. Jinan, the capital city of Shandong Province in eastern China, is selected for empirical analysis. Findings show that development degree, circulation degree, and SDD of the 3E system in Jinan are increasing basically, and temporal trend of development degree and SDD of 3E system is synchronized. This shows that 3E system in Jinan has been improved gradually during this period, and the development of 3E system is a key factor affecting its sustainability. In 2015-2017, circulation degree and SDD were superimposed and developed in parallel, indicating that Jinan has entered the primary stage of high-quality development. The obstacle degree model is introduced to explore the main factors that impede the sustainable development of 3E system in Jinan. This study revealed that the energy consumption structure, the proportion of new energy utilization, the development of tertiary industry, and water resources protection are the key issues that should be addressed in the sustainable development of 3E system in Jinan. The top-level design concerning these issues should be highlighted in the forthcoming 14th five-year plan period.","RENEWABLE ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT; CARBON EMISSIONS; CO2 EMISSIONS; SYSTEM; GROWTH; URBANIZATION; CONSTRUCTION; INDICATORS; IMPACTS","combined weights; high-quality development; sustainable development; the obstacle model","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Wang, QS##Xu, ZP##Yuan, Q##Yuan, XL##Zuo, J##Song, YZ##Wang, MS","[Wang, Qingsong; Xu, Zhaopeng; Yuan, Xueliang] Shandong Univ, Natl Engn Lab Reducing Emiss Coal Combust, Engn Res Ctr Environm Thermal Technol,Shandong Ke, Sch Energy & Power Engn,Minist Educ,Res Ctr Susta, Jinan 250061, Shandong, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000561881200001",2020,"The approach of Indian corporates towards sustainable development: An exploration using sustainable development goals based model","This study aims to evaluate the contribution of the Indian corporate world towards sustainable development. We propose a framework of Corporate Sustainability Performance derived from factors suggested by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a component of a global agenda for sustainability. This framework is further applied to evaluate the sustainability performance of Indian firms to identify potential gaps in their sustainability efforts. The impact of factors like firm-size, ownership structure, and environmental sensitivity of firms has been statistically tested for these firms. The paper uses a mixed-method where content analysis has been applied to generate the data by analyzing disclosure reports of the top 100 Indian firms for the year 2016-2017, and a mathematical model is used to arrive at sustainability performance factors at various levels. Statistical tools like descriptive analytics,ttest, and analysis of variance are used to test various hypotheses. The findings suggest a significant gap in the full potential and current status of sustainability investments by Indian corporates and hence confirm a huge improvement potential. ""Cement"" is the best performing sector, whereas ""Media"" is at the bottom of the performance stack. The Indian corporate world aligns its maximum effort along the ""Education and Learning"" dimension, whereas minimum effort is made for ""Oceans, Sea, and Marine."" A significant difference was found for the performance based on environment sensitivity and firm-size. Differences across firms based on ownership identity and concentration could not be established. The study highlights the implications for the regulatory mechanism that needs to change if the contribution from the private sector is required for SDGs.","FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE LINK; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; REPORTING PRACTICES; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CSR; DISCLOSURE; DETERMINANTS","content analysis; corporate performance; corporate sustainability model; Indian organizations; SDG; sustainability; sustainability performance; sustainable development","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Jha, MK##Rangarajan, K","[Jha, Milind Kumar] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Res Div, New Delhi, India.

However, there is lack of harmonized approach in addressing agricultural sustainability issues as different policies are targeting different sustainability issues in agriculture. This article analyses sustainable agriculture development and agriculture sustainability concepts and sustainability assessment approaches and tools developed for agriculture sector. Based on systematic critical literature review, this article develops the new indicators framework for sustainability assessment in agriculture which allows us to achieve harmonization of sustainable development, climate and agricultural policies in European Union (EU). The proposed indicators framework allows us to address the main sustainability issues of agriculture by linking them with sustainable development goals, environmental, climate and rural development policy priorities in EU. The main contribution of this article is linking rural policy goals with sustainable development, climate change mitigation and environmental policy goals by providing agricultural sustainability assessment framework allowing us to track these linkages through indicators system.","MULTICRITERIA DECISION-ANALYSIS; SYSTEMS; BIODIVERSITY; INDEX; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; ASKING","climate change; framework; indicators; rural development; sustainable development goals; sustainable agriculture","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Streimikis, J##Balezentis, T","[Streimikis, Justas; Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vivulskio G 4A-13, LT-03220 Vilnius, Lithuania.","Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning","Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration","Abson D.

"J","WOS:000562702400004",2021,"Dynamic interactive links among sustainable energy investment, air pollution, and sustainable development in regional China","This research investigates the dynamic interactive associations among sustainable investment in the energy sector, air pollution, and sustainable development. To this end, it employs a ""one-step"" system-generalized method of moments (GMM) and ""one-step"" differential-GMM estimators, covering the period between 1996 and 2017. In this context, it utilizes the simultaneous equations of the dynamic panel data model for panel data of 27 Chinese provinces and municipalities. We have developed a new model of sustainable development, which incorporates sustainable investment in the energy sector and air pollution to offer a robust theoretical foundation for considering the underlying relations. The system-GMM estimator is used for the full data set; however, differential-GMM is utilized for the subsets of data, in order to tackle the small sample bias problem. The empirical outcomes provide several vital insights in that they yield mixed findings for the aggregated sample and subsets of data. For example, a two-way causal relationship occurs for all the panels, except the central part (medium development regions), between sustainable investment in the energy sector and sustainable development. Contrary to this, causality runs from air pollution to sustainable investment in the energy sector in a full data set and the central part (medium dev.). Nevertheless, the opposite is true in the case of the eastern part (most developed regions) of China. Still, the same relationship runs in either direction in the case of the western part (least developed regions). On the other way around, the feedback hypothesis of causality is confirmed, across all the samples, between air pollution and sustainable development. Hence, sustainable development and air pollution are overwhelmingly interdependent, in the country as well as the province and municipality level of the Chinese economy.","ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; RENEWABLE ENERGY; CO2 EMISSIONS; HEALTH EXPENDITURES; CARBON EMISSIONS; CONSUMPTION; PANEL; ELECTRICITY; TECHNOLOGY","Sustainable development; Air pollution; Sustainable investment in energy sector; Generalized method of moments; Disaggregated analysis","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","Ahmad, M##Chandio, AA##Solangi, YA##Shah, SAA##Shahzad, F##Rehman, A##Jabeen, G","[Ahmad, Munir] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000564630800046",2020,"The role of linked legitimacy in sustainable business model development","In this paper we use legitimacy as a lens to explore how sustainable business models (SBMs) develop within and across business ecosystems. We explore legitimacy as a resource that is created through sustainable development projects. We introduce the idea of linked legitimacy as a key driver for developing SBMs both within the business ecosystem of the focal firm, and in the overlapping ecosystems of their stakeholders. Using data from three business cases we explore different ways firms build and exploit linked legitimacy and how this leads to SBM development. We suggest that linked legitimacy can cross firm boundaries as a resource to be exploited broadly by ecosystem stakeholders. Finally, we re-conceptualize the rules of engagement for developing SBMs. In our model of SBM development, each firm then takes advantage of the resource (linked legitimacy) available in the ecosystem and is free to use it opportunistically, which drives SBM development.","DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIC ALLIANCE; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEMS; ADOPTION; SUPPORT; PROFIT; FIRMS; VIEW","Business models; Business model development; Ecosystem; Legitimacy; Sustainable business models; Sustainable development","INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT","Press, M##Robert, I##Maillefert, M","[Press, Melea] Skema Business Sch MERCUR, Ave Willy Brandt, F-59777 Euralille, France.

"J","WOS:000566387000001",2020,"Storytelling for sustainable development in rural communities: An alternative approach","Mainstream conceptualizations of sustainable development (SD) tend to focus on urban areas or the national or global scale-most recently through the Sustainable Development Goals. This focus often overlooks rural and natural resource-based communities, particularly those dependent on renewable resources like fisheries or forestry. Drawing from a comprehensive review, we propose an alternative approach for interpreting and measuring SD in these contexts. We integrate two seemingly contradictory approaches: sustainability indicators (SIs), whose evolution reflects competing views of the nature of knowledge and action in pursuit of SD, and the use of storytelling in policy and planning, highlighting how actors tell stories to garner support for proposed developments, influence public understanding, and mobilize stakeholders. Examining the opposing epistemologies often underlying these two approaches, we posit that they can be brought together through a transdisciplinary lens for sustainable rural development. We illustrate these potentials in Newfoundland and Labrador, a highly resource-based region in which rural communities are often characterized by deficiencies based narratives. In such contexts, storytelling can allow rural stakeholders to interpret SD while potentially enlisting SIs in telling their own sustainability stories.","INDICATORS; GOVERNANCE; SYSTEMS; NEWFOUNDLAND; LIVELIHOODS; FRAMEWORK; FISHERIES; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; LESSONS","rural development; stakeholder engagement; storytelling; sustainability indicators; sustainable development","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Lowery, B##Dagevos, J##Chuenpagdee, R##Vodden, K","[Lowery, Brennan] Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, Canada.

Evidence from Vietnam","This article investigates the concepts and issues of social enterprise, social entrepreneurship, their sustainability and strategic dimension. Regarding the current two contradictory forms of entrepreneurship (commercial and social entrepreneurship) in terms of their nature, motivation, purpose and orientation toward sustainable development, this research shows that both of them could to stay in an alliance to successfully bridge social and commercial capital for corporate sustainable development and social sustainable development. However, the article revealed that in contrast to the commercial entrepreneurship, currently, social entrepreneurship, due to higher level of sophistication, lacks and needs more strategic approach and understanding as well as its full reflection not only in theoretical debates but also in the business reality. This way, enterprises and society could benefit from it in terms of supporting overall sustainable development in rural areas of Vietnam. Finally, the article proposed some feasible solutions to enhance strategic impact of social entrepreneurship and promote its further expansion for the purpose of sustainable development.","RESPONSIBILITY","sustainable entrepreneurship; social entrepreneurship; social enterprise; sustainable development; Vietnam","COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT","Tien, NH##Minh, HTT##Duc, LM##Mai, NP##Thuc, TD","[Hoang Tien, Nguyen; Minh, Ho Thien Thong] Saigon Int Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

This article examines WIPO's approach to the sustainable development agenda in light of its past approaches to development. In the first part of this article, I outline some of the longstanding major critiques of the discourse of sustainability, noting that these critiques anticipated the current lamentable status of a sustainable development agenda for WIPO. Next, I discuss the history of development agendas at WIPO in the context of WIPO's history and role at the centre of the global intellectual property system. I then ask what role intellectual property has to play in the SDGs.

"J","WOS:000567481000003",2020,"Multidirectional Relationship between Energy Resources, Climate Changes and Sustainable Development: Technoeconomic Analysis","Global changes in temperature will likely change energy use and electricity production capacity. Considering the relationship between climate change and energy resource use, changes in temperature and the frequency and intensity of extreme events will affect how much energy is produced and consumed. The green economy and green growth are located at the heart of the fight against climate change in creating sustainable development. This paper considers the multidirectional relations between climate change, energy resources, and sustainable development including the perspective of a green economy via a technoeconomic analysis. A link among energy resources, climate changes and sustainable development has been displayed via a technoeconomic analysis in the case study, which was focused on taking into consideration the needs of the hydroponic units, the product selling price, the electricity price of the wind farm (WF), and at the same time the energy demand, under a nexus approach. Via the technoeconomic analysis, it was proven that moving on to smaller investments of 2 MWs is more efficient compared to larger projects e.g. 18 MWs, however, this cannot be considered immediately as the preferred solution since it is always a matter of impact on the local society.","ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CARBON EMISSION; DECOMPOSITION; CONSUMPTION; INTEGRATION; SCALE","Energy resource; Climate changes; Sustainable development; Green economy; Technoeconomic analysis; Case study","SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY","Ucal, M##Xydis, G","[Ucal, Meltem] Kadir Has Univ, Ctr Energy & Sustainable Dev, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.

"J","WOS:000568783300014",2020,"Cleaner production for achieving the sustainable development goals","Cleaner production is a lively concept in which new procedures and technologies constantly emerge introducing methods and practices to prevent damages to the environment. A broad range of cleaner production initiatives contribute to sustainable development not only through the efficient management of resources and energy, but also through the development of new and smart technologies, new ways of assisting policies development, and organizing supply chains, sectors and individual companies. The authors of this Virtual Special Issue sought to introduce first-hand knowledge and discussions identifying and highlighting the ways cleaner production can contribute to reach the United Nations sustainable development targets. The intent of the Virtual Special Issue is to provide an overview of the recent trends that cleaner production practitioners/researchers are following in the chase of the sustainable development goals, and in this context, this editorial was designed to summarize and underscore the link between cleaner production concepts and practices and the sustainable development goals. An adequate response to this challenge required scientific knowledge and reassessment of the papers ensuring that the science is responsive to the evolving needs of sustainable development. This Virtual Special Issue of the Journal of Cleaner Production is mainly dedicated to the 7th International Workshop on Advances in Cleaner Production, held at Universidad de La Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia on 21-22 June 2018. Based upon the examination of the papers of this Virtual Special Issue, the authors were able to establish that there is an pressing need for research on the assessment on which/when cleaner production interventions are more effective; inter and multidisciplinary cooperation among social and technical scientists to distinguish and address the cleaner production/sustainable development goals interactions and connect cleaner production solutions and large-scale sustainability approaches.

As the largest developing country, China faces large regional imbalances in its economy and social welfare. A nationwide synthetic indicator cannot reflect the sustainable development profile. As SDGs have not been evaluated at the national level of China and related studies worldwide at national or sub-national levels are rare, this paper aims to present a quantitative assessment of sustainable development goals at the sub-national level in China. We constructed a sustainable development index and dashboard evaluation framework under the SDGs and evaluated sustainable development indicators at the provincial scale to explore the sub-national heterogeneity. Results showed that the state of sustainable development in China is characterized by its pronounced geographic zones. Eastern provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have the highest scores of the China SDG Index. By contrast, western provinces, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi, have the lowest scores. We observe that both the Green Development Index and per capita GDP have very significant positive correlations with the China SDG Index and many single SDGs. Prioritizing economic development is beneficial to the implementation of the sustainable development goals for the western provinces, while trade-offs between economic development and environmental protection must be considered for eastern provinces.","AFRICA","Sustainable development goals; Social welfare; Green development index; Spatial variability; China","ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT","Wang, YC##Lu, YL##He, GZ##Wang, CC##Yuan, JJ##Cao, XH","[Wang, Yichao; Lu, Yonglong; He, Guizhen; Wang, Chenchen; Yuan, Jingjing; Cao, Xianghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.

It is of great significance to plan and develop tourism purposefully and sustainably though the search for compromises between environmental, economic and social aims of society. The sustainable tourism development management has to retain high satisfaction degree of tourists' needs, assure significant experience for consumers, increasing their consciousness under issues of sustainability, and propagating practices of sustainable tourism among them. The significance of sustainable tourism sector development ambition is analysed in this paper through the lens of strengthening its competitiveness. The paper analyses scientific literature and seeks to discover the main forms and factors for the strengthening of the tourism competitiveness by implementing economic, social and environmental targets of tourism destination territories development. The broad systematic literature review provided for some interesting findings: The business participants are interested in the implementation of new technologies in tourism services having positive impact on environment and local communities; however, a lot of challenges exist how to change environment, increase of consumers' motivations for sustainable tourism services and to change their behaviour towards more sustainable one. The current Covid 19 outbreak and high risks of future pandemics have risen new challenges for sustainable tourism development. In this paper the main sustainable tourist development challenges are addressed and new insights for the strengthening of competitiveness of sustainable tourism destination are provided. The future research guidelines are set based on analysis performed.

"J","WOS:000571887100001",2020,"Monitoring sustainable development by means of earth observation data and machine learning: a review","This paper presents and explores the different Earth Observation approaches and their contribution to the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A review on the Sustainable Development concept and its goals is presented followed by Earth Observation approaches relevant to this field, giving special attention to the contribution of Machine Learning methods and algorithms as well as their potential and capabilities to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, it is observed that Earth Observation plays a key role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals given its cost-effectiveness pertaining to data acquisition on all scales and information richness. Despite the success of Machine Learning upon Earth Observation data analysis, it is observed that performance is heavily dependent on the ability to extract and synthesise characteristics from data. Hence, a deeper and effective analysis of the available data is required to identify the strongest features and, hence, the key factors pertaining to Sustainable Development. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, given the relevance and growing amount of data generated through Earth Observation, it is concluded that there is an increased need for new methods and techniques strongly suggesting the use of new Machine Learning techniques.","FEATURE-SELECTION; DIMENSION REDUCTION; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; SATELLITE IMAGERY; CLUSTERING METHOD; RANDOM FOREST; BIG DATA; VEGETATION; SEGMENTATION; CONSTRAINTS","Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals; Earth observation data; Machine learning","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE","Ferreira, B##Iten, M##Silva, RG","[Ferreira, Bruno] Inst Soldadura & Qual, ISQ Intelligent & Digital Syst R&Di, Rua Mirante 258, P-4415491 Grijo, Portugal.

Sustainable leadership is a new domain of effective leadership, which has been established recently to cope with issues related to sustainable development. On the subject of natural resource-based view (NRBV) and dynamic capability theory, this study examined methods of embedding sustainable leadership into sustainable performance and investigated the mediating effect of organizational learning to sustainable leadership and sustainable performance. The data in this study were collected from a total of 369 small and medium-sized enterprises in Pakistan using a purposive sampling technique. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results revealed (a) a significant positive effect of sustainable leadership on organizational learning; (b) organizational learning significantly influences sustainable performance; (c) organizational learning partially mediates the relationship between sustainable leadership and sustainable performance. The present study offered an in-depth theory of NRBV, dynamic capability, and sustainable development.

Urban migratory population from rural to urban has encountered towards sustainable urban planning. Being an issue of argument since earlier decades, the sustainability has always been endeavoured towards development of suitable sustainable indicators for Indian scenarios. The introduction of a smart city concept has provided an open space for development of integrated sustainable hybrid index consisting of the social, economic, and environmental aspects of the system. The current note tries to conceptualize the development, evaluation, and implementation of a new hybrid index for sustainable development considering multi-dimensional indicators. This index can be broadly envisioned to implement three key parameters like social, economic, and environmental components, with an ancillary parameter likecitizen perceptionas a fourth parameter to provide a significant role towards sustainable smart cities. These will assist development of sustainable smart cities and contribution of urban constraints towards rising environmental issues to provide a proposition for implementation of hybrid index as a worthy tool for better sustainable smart cities development.",NA,"Smart cities; Sustainable development; Hybrid index; Performance","JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING","Misra, M##Kumar, D","[Misra, Mandvi; Kumar, Deepak] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Inst Geoinformat & Remote Sensing AIGIRS, Sect 125, Noida 201313, Uttar Pradesh, India.","Environmental Sciences; Remote Sensing","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing","Albino V, 2015, J URBAN TECHNOL, V22, P3, DOI 10.1080/10630732.2014.942092##Alcamo J., 2018, INTERACTIONS SUSTAIN##[Anonymous], 2015, SERVICE LEVEL BENCHM##Ariken M, 2020, ECOL INDIC, V114, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106331##Ates S, 2020, J CLEAN PROD, V250, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119465##Benintendi R, 2020, SUSTAIN FUTUR, V2, P100009, DOI [10.1016/j.sftr.2020.100009, DOI 10.1016/J.SFTR.2020.100009]##Bureau of Indian Standards, 2017, TECHN REQ AN UN SEC##Buzasi A, 2020, SUSTAIN CITIES SOC, V62, DOI 10.1016/j.scs.2020.102388##Chen H, 2019, ECOLOGICAL INDICATOR, V115, P106370##Elliot T, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11102766##Enoguanbhor EC, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11051313##Feola G., 2020, J RURAL STUD, P0##Geissdoerfer M, 2017, J CLEAN PROD, V143, P757, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048##Harrou F., 2021, UNSUPERVISED DEEP LE##Hayat P, 2016, INDIA Q, V72, P177, DOI 10.1177/0974928416637930##Hickel J, 2020, ECOL ECON, V167, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.05.011##Hiremath RB, 2013, ENERGY SUSTAIN DEV, V17, P555, DOI 10.1016/j.esd.2013.08.004##Hollands R., 2008, CITY, V12, P303, DOI DOI 10.1080/13604810802479126##Jiang F, 2007, J GEOGR SCI, V17, P469, DOI 10.1007/s11442-007-0469-z##Klk S., 2019, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V103, P529, DOI [10.1016/j.rser.2018.11.006, DOI 10.1016/J.RSER.2018.11.006]##Krishna P., 2016, ADOPTION STANDARDS S##Labib SM, 2020, COMPUT ENVIRON URBAN, V82, DOI 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101501##Li JT, 2020, APPL GEOGR, V117, DOI 10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102187##Mapar M, 2020, SUSTAIN CITIES SOC, V60, DOI 10.1016/j.scs.2020.102164##Marti L, 2020, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, V84, DOI 10.1016/j.eiar.2020.106375##Martinez C, 2020, APPL GEOGR, V116, DOI 10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102166##Morelli J., 2011, J ENV SUSTAINABILITY, V1, P1, DOI [10.14448/jes.01.0002, DOI 10.14448/JES.01.0002]##Nathan S.

The impact of their development is directly felt by local, regional, national or global communities. The purpose of the paper is to investigate and measure this impact on the sustainable development in three major areas: economic, social and environmental, by selecting representative indicators. Following the conducted research, the authors propose a calculation model of a composite index for the evaluation of regional sustainable development. The flexibility of the indicator selection system and the building of the composite index will allow simulations of the development of local communities, depending on the development factors considered as a priority in the central and local policies at that time. This solution is supported by the results of a statistical analysis in Romania, in which the authors used data from 2007-2017 for 8 development regions.","INDEX; INDICATORS","regional sustainable development; calculation model for evaluating regional sustainable development; composite index","ECONOMIC COMPUTATION AND ECONOMIC CYBERNETICS STUDIES AND RESEARCH","Botha, I##Botezatu, MA##Coanca, M","[Botha, Iuliana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.

We show that firms following prospector strategy engage in less sustainable development behaviors than those following defender strategies. The negative relation between business strategy and green innovation continues to hold when addressing robustness with alternatives of business strategy and green innovation and addressing potential endogeneity with instrumental variable. We further find that political connection strengthens whereas environmental regulation weakens the negative relation between business strategy and green innovation. Finally, we explore the economic consequences of green innovation caused by strategic differences.

Their aggregation requires some tradeoffs from stakeholders with different priorities and preferences. The aim of this paper is to develop a multiple objectives decision aid model where stakeholders' preferences are explicitly integrated within a group decision-making process based on consensus and tradeoffs. This model is based on the concept of the satisfaction function, where stakeholders' preferences are explicitly taken into consideration. The developed model is illustrated through an example related to the Canadian 2030 agenda for sustainable development.","ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; CARBON-DIOXIDE

The reduction of education for sustainable development to the issue of environmental education poses a threat to the values associated with the humanistic interpretation of education. Firstly, it is the absolutization of environmental values and the lack of effective synthesis of these values with social values, and economic values partly. Secondly, there is a lack of needs and values of teachers and value-methodological principles of integration of environmental and humanistic values. Thirdly, to a large extent on the periphery of education for sustainable development are the problems of transformation of society itself, social relations, culture, ways of communication, interaction of people with each other, as well as the emotional component of such interaction. One of the possible ways to solve these problems can be considered the formation of new, more adapted to the needs of sustainable development of value-cognitive characteristics of teachers. The new model of education should provide a focus on people as the main object of sustainable development, subordinating value changes to the task of socialization and humanization of social development, taking into account environmental constraints. Based on the results of the study, it is necessary to pay attention to the development of social intelligence, emotional intelligence, communicative intelligence and practical intelligence. For more adequate training of professionals in the field of education for sustainable development, it is advisable to expand cooperation with governmental and non-governmental organizations.",NA,"education; sustainable development; humanism; ecology; training; values; social intelligence","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Galtseva, T##Svitich, S##Kutsiy, A##Savchenko, V##Strukova, T","[Galtseva, Tetyana] Dnipro Acad Continuing Educ, Dept Psychol, Dnipro, Ukraine.

"J","WOS:000577322100001",2020,"Social and environmental development: Fresh concepts and soft measures towards sustainable development","With the incremental growth in overall world population, environmental related aftermaths of industrial development are becoming challenges for sustainability. In social perspective, poverty eradication is still the biggest global need which is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable development (SD). As a solution, business organizations in various industries need to do the efforts with zero-sum competition for a trailblazing initiative of SD in context of social and environmental protection. Based on triple bottom line theory, this paper introduces the terminologies of social and environmental collective protection (SECP) and social and environmental collective development (SECD) by answering the research question as how the nonprofit orientation can be promoted and sustained within the for-profit businesses. Using textual analytical approach, this research achieves the main objective to highlight the impact of mutual corporate initiatives as a business strategy on social and environmental sustainability. This article finds that social and environmental development depends upon social and environmental protection when it is measured in terms of collective SD goals. In addition to initiating the new terminologies contributing to the literature of SD measures for society and environment, this paper has practical implications for United Nations (UN) for their 2030 vision of social development for SD. Utilization of this paper is not limited till 2030 because it is expected that a broad range of researchers will use our described concepts for scholarly discussions and future empirical studies.","STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT; LEADING FIRMS; RESPONSIBILITY; BEHAVIOR; PROTECTION; LEADERSHIP; COMPANIES; PROGRAMS; SUPPORT; PRICES","business management; corporate social initiatives; environment; environmental development; environmental protection; social development; social protection; sustainability; sustainable development goals","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Farooq, Q##Hao, J##Liu, X##Xiao, D##Hao, YH","[Farooq, Qamar] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Jinhua, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Similarly, this diffusion was also given to the term sustainability, commonly associated with the expression of sustainable development phenomenon that sometimes appears as its synonym. In this context, this paper aims to discuss some of the key concepts of sustainable development and sustainability, with a view to characterizing both phenomena of broader concepts and definitions (macro country) to less comprehensive (micro organizations). It is considered the end that, far from being a negative, this ambiguity and multiplicity of visions come to attest dynamic characteristics, heterogeneity and contingentiality for sustainable development phenomenon. Similarly, the sustainability phenomenon also reflects its own multidimensionality, being considered now attribute required by the standards of sustainable development, sometimes a feature of its processes and practices, or even a property of ecosystems and human societies developed within the context of organizations.","EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; BUSINESS; SYSTEMS; GOALS; IDEA","Sustainable development; Sustainability; Theoretical essay","REUNIR-REVISTA DE ADMINISTRACAO CONTABILIDADE E SUSTENTABILIDADE","Machado, DD##Matos, FRN","[Machado, Diego de Queiroz] Univ Fed Ceara UFC, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.

The article entails a systematic analysis of greenfield and brownfield development attributes, evaluated in terms of sustainable development target indicators, in order to determine which development category best contributes to sustainable development. A qualitative research method was applied using a combination of interviews, case studies and literature reviews. Based on content analysis and coding, the thematic analysis results confirm that the long-term sustainability benefits of brownfield developments outweigh the short-term financial gains of greenfield developments. Recommendations, including establishing partnerships and funding models, identifying and defining development strategies for brownfield sites as well as implementing and enforcing legislation, could contribute towards realising sustainable, resilient, safe and inclusive human settlements on vacant mine dumps.","URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; SMART GROWTH; INDICATORS; CHALLENGE; SPRAWL; REUSE","Brownfield; climate change; globalisation; sustainable development; sustainable development goals; urbanisation; urban sprawl","TOWN AND REGIONAL PLANNING","Venter, T","[Venter, Tersia] Earthscape Pty Ltd, 6 Dorette St, ZA-7646 Paarl, South Africa.","Regional & Urban Planning","Public Administration","ADAMS D., 2002, GREENFIELDS BROWNFIE, DOI DOI 10.1002/9780470757222##Arku G, 2009, URBAN FORUM, V20, P253, DOI DOI 10.1007/S12132-009-9047-Z##Behan K, 2008, CAN GEOGR-GEOGR CAN, V52, P291, DOI 10.1111/j.1541-0064.2008.00214.x##BOBBINS K.L., 2013, WIT T ECOLOGY ENV, V8, P1363##Braun V., 2006, QUALITATIVE RES PSYC, V3, P77, DOI [DOI 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa, 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa, DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP063OA]##CLARINET (CONTAMINATED LAND REHABILITATION NETWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES), 2002, BROWNF RED URB AR RE##Clarke V, 2013, PSYCHOLOGIST, V26, P120##Cornelissen AMG, 2001, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V86, P173, DOI 10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00272-3##De Sousa C.

"J","WOS:000579002800001",2020,"Identifying Key Issues of Education for Sustainable Development","This paper elaborates and presents key issues established for a course on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). ESD is supported by the United Nations (UN) organization and its agency, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Quality education is also one of the seventeen UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The evolution of sustainable development and ESD is overviewed first in order to define the most important content of ESD in future teaching. Because of the fast development of humankind in all the SD pillars (economic, social and environmental), the climate crises as well as the new technologies and knowledge emerging, education leaders and teachers are lacking modern and effective content for ESD. Therefore, twelve key issues of ESD are identified and elaborated in the present article. The issues are organized into four groups (approach, contents, teaching, and organization) with three items each. The approach is including ESD scope, policy, and cooperation, the contents part deals with the three ESD pillars - environmental, social and economic; the third group, teaching, regards ESD methodologies, transformative teaching and learning, and capacity building; the organization group presents ESD metrics, documents, and institutions. The twelve issues have been synthesized after reviewing the available literature, enhanced by the participation in several international projects on education. In addition, they were further elaborated from feedback obtained from three international conferences focused on education for sustainable development, social responsibility, and sustainable consumption and production. The key goals suggested by the audience of the international conference in Vienna were holistic education, stakeholders' awareness, participation and cooperation, and building capacity of stakeholders, while the challenge was found to be the timely evolution of human society towards the deep transformation. This paper is an informed perspective proposing content for an Education for Sustainable Development course.","CONSUMPTION GOVERNANCE; LEADERS; DEBATE","education; sustainable development; key issues;

"J","WOS:000580616100001",2021,"Renewable energy consumption and sustainable development in high-income countries","This study aims to analyse the relationship between renewable energy, non-renewable energy, economic growth and sustainable development in high-income countries. This analysis uses data from 20 high-income countries covering the 1990-2015 period and finds that there is a cointegration relationship among the considered variables. According to the estimation of long-term coefficients for the cointegrated variables, renewable energy consumption has a statistically significant positive effect on sustainable development in the long run. In high-income countries, a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption increases sustainable development by 0.326%. In contrast, non-renewable energy consumption has a statistically significant negative effect on sustainable development in the long run. In high-income countries, a 1% increase in non-renewable energy consumption reduces sustainable development by 1.004%. According to the Granger causality estimates obtained in this study, renewable energy is the cause of sustainable development in both the short and long term. These findings demonstrate the importance of renewable energy consumption to sustainable development in high-income countries. Therefore, while high-income countries increase renewable energy consumption, they should decrease non-renewable energy consumption as much as possible.","NONRENEWABLE ENERGY; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; ERROR-CORRECTION; BIOMASS ENERGY; TIME-SERIES; UNIT-ROOT; GDP; EMISSIONS","Sustainable development; renewable energy; non-renewable energy; high-income countries; panel ARDL","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","Guney, T","[Guney, Taner] Karamanoglu Mehmetbey Univ, Econ, Karaman, Turkey.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Ahmed MM, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en12152954##Aidt TokeS., 2010, CORRUPTION SUSTAINAB##Al-mulali U, 2013, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V22, P209, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2013.02.005##Apergis N, 2014, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V4##Apergis N, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V127, P1011, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.043##Apergis N, 2010, ENERG ECON, V32, P1392, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2010.06.001##Arminen H, 2019, ENERG ECON, V80, P621, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2019.02.009##Aydin M, 2019, RENEW ENERG, V138, P620, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.001##Ben Jebli M, 2020, STRUCT CHANGE ECON D, V53, P402, DOI 10.1016/j.strueco.2019.12.009##Bilgili F, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V71, P830, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.109##Bozkurt C, 2015, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V5##Breitung J, 2000, NONSTATIONARY PANELS##BREUSCH TS, 1980, REV ECON STUD, V47, P239, DOI 10.2307/2297111##Busu M, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en12040578##Dees S, 2007, J APPL ECONOMET, V22, P1, DOI 10.1002/jae.932##DICKEY DA, 1979, J AM STAT ASSOC, V74, P427, DOI 10.2307/2286348##Dietzenbacher E, 2020, APPL ENERG, V258, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114040##ENGLE RF, 1987, ECONOMETRICA, V55, P251, DOI 10.2307/1913236##Gautam P, 2019, CURRENT DEV BIOTECHN##Gorus MS, 2019, ENERGY, V168, P815, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2018.11.139##Guney T, 2020, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V27, P762, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2020.1753124##Guney T, 2019, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V26, P389, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2019.1595214##Guney T, 2017, J INT TRADE ECON DEV, V26, P316, DOI 10.1080/09638199.2016.1249391##Hamilton K, 1999, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V13, P333, DOI 10.1093/wber/13.2.333##Hamilton K., 2005, 2498 WORLD BANK##Huang BN, 2008, ECOL ECON, V67, P41, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.11.006##Im KS, 2003, J ECONOMETRICS, V115, P53, DOI 10.1016/S0304-4076(03)00092-7##International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2020, GLOB REN OUTL EN TRA##Jacobson MZ, 2009, ENERG ENVIRON SCI, V2, P148, DOI 10.1039/b809990c##Levin A, 2002, J ECONOMETRICS, V108, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0304-4076(01)00098-7##Lyeonov S, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en12203891##McKinlay A, 2019, URBAN POLICY RES, V37, DOI 10.1080/08111146.2017.1374944##Ocal O, 2013, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V3##Ozcan B, 2019, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V104, P30, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2019.01.020##Ozturk I, 2011, APPL ENERG, V88, P2885, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.01.065##Pao HT, 2019, J CLEAN PROD, V206, P907, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.190##Pedroni P, 1999, OXFORD B ECON STAT, V61, P653, DOI 10.1111/1468-0084.0610s1653##Pedroni P, 2004, EC THEORY##Pesaran M.H., 2004, CAMBRIDGE WORKING PA, V0435##Pesaran M.H., 2004, GEN DIAGNOSTIC TESTS##Pesaran MH, 2008, ECONOMET J, V11, P105, DOI 10.1111/j.1368-423X.2007.00227.x##PESARAN MH, 1995, J ECONOMETRICS, V68, P79, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01644-F##Pesaran MH, 1999, J AM STAT ASSOC, V94, P621, DOI 10.2307/2670182##PHILLIPS PCB, 1988, BIOMETRIKA, V75, P335, DOI 10.2307/2336182##Shabani ZD, 2019, ENERGY, V169, P1064, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2018.11.062##Sharif A, 2019, RENEW ENERG, V133, P685, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2018.10.052##Sikder A, 2019, APPL ENERG, V235, P930, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.092##Sinha A, 2015, INT J ENERGY EC POLI, V5##Sirag A, 2018, J ENVIRON ECON POLIC, V7, P145, DOI 10.1080/21606544.2017.1382395##Soytas U, 2003, ENERG ECON, V25, P33, DOI 10.1016/S0140-9883(02)00009-9##Spaiser V, 2019, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V26, P282, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2018.1559252##Topcu E, 2020, RESOUR POLICY, V66, DOI 10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101622##Tugcu CT, 2012, ENERG ECON, V34, P1942, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2012.08.021##WCED, 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE WO##Westerlund J, 2007, OXFORD B ECON STAT, V69, P709, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00477.x##World Bank, 2020, DAT IND##World Energy Council, 2019, WORLD EN SCEN 2019##Zeppini P, 2020, ENERG POLICY, V136, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2019.110907",1,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM6","no","SDG.7"

Contemporarys development discourse puts the onus on every governmental and non-governmental organisation to contribute towards sustainable development. Banks play a critical role in the achievement of sustainable development goals due to its intermediary role in the economy. Recently, various international guidelines and roadmap were developed to promote the notion of sustainable development such as Equator principles, PRI, UNEP FI, and Global reporting initiatives (GRI). The purpose of this paper was to discuss the evolution of the notion of sustainable development vis-a-vis the role of banking institutions in sustainable development and also examined contemporary national and international initiatives that propagate the role of banks towards sustainable development and finally suggested a framework to achieve sustainable development through sustainable banking practices.","MANAGEMENT","Banking; CSR; environment protection; green banking; social development; sustainable banking; sustainable development","INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT","Kumar, K##Prakash, A##Khan, W","[Kumar, Kishore; Khan, Waseem] GLA Univ, Inst Business Management, Mathura, India.

"J","WOS:000581605600060",2020,"Review of indicators for sustainable energy development","Sustainable energy development has become an international policy objective and an integral part of sustainable development. It is necessary to develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators to monitor progress towards sustainable energy development. This analysis aimed to assess established indicator sets for sustainable energy development. The characteristics of a comprehensive and robust indicator set were identified to enable such an assessment and used as a basis for six assessment criteria; transparency of indicator selection and indicator application, conceptual framework, representative, linkages, and stakeholder engagement. A total of 57 indicator sets were found that monitor progress towards sustainable energy development or some aspects of it. All but one of these indicator sets were found to be lacking in some aspect, especially regarding a lack of transparency and consideration of linkages between indicators, presentation of an imbalanced picture, and no involvement of stakeholders during indicator development. The only indicator set that met all criteria were Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development developed jointly by multiple international agencies. Nonetheless, several flaws in this set were identified. The Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development could be considered as an initial basket of indicators for further refinement in the context where they will be applied to ensure their policy relevance and usefulness.

"J","WOS:000581865600001",2021,"The UK'S largest volume housebuilders and the sustainable development goals","Purpose The sustainable development goals (SDGs) agreed at a United Nations General Assembly in 2015 embrace an ambitious and wide ranging set of global environmental, social and economic issues designed to effect a transition to a more sustainable future. The United Nations called on all governments to pursue these ambitious goals but also acknowledged the important role of the private sector in addressing the SDGs. This paper offers an exploratory review of how some of the UK's largest volume housebuilders publicly claim to be committed to addressing the SDGs. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides an outline of the characteristics of sustainable development, of the SDGs and of the frame of reference and method of enquiry employed in the study, prior to reviewing the findings from the largest UK housebuilders. Findings The findings revealed that seven of the largest housebuilding companies claimed to be committed to contributing to the SDGs, though the scale and the extent of their claimed commitments varied. In reviewing the housebuilders approach to the SDGs, the authors drew attention to three challenges the housebuilders may face in pursuing their claimed commitment to the SDGs, namely, concentrating on specific goals, measurement and reporting. Originality/value The paper offers an accessible review of how seven of the UK's largest housebuilders claimed to be committed to addressing the SDGs.","NEOLIBERALISM","Sustainable development goals; Housebuilding companies; UK; Reporting; SDG wash","PROPERTY MANAGEMENT","Jones, P##Comfort, D","[Jones, Peter] Univ Gloucestershire, Sch Business, Sustainable Dev, Cheltenham, Glos, England.

Therefore, a growing discussion has emerged within academia and practice around how pedagogical methods and tools can be utilized for this purpose. This paper seeks to contribute to this discussion by asking 'in which way may group model building be used to foster learning that leads to competency for strategic sustainable development?'. The potential of the group model building (GMB) process' steps and associated modeling to foster learning for strategic sustainable development (SSD) was analyzed using four case examples. Theory on learning for sustainability and key sustainability competencies were linked to elements of a process for strategic planning toward sustainability within the framework for strategic sustainable development (FSSD) as a reference model. The results provide a discussion on how GMB can be utilized to foster sustainability competencies and learning for sustainability that can contribute to SSD, hence a basis for continued research and ideas for course and curriculum development.","FRAMEWORK","learning for sustainability; sustainability competencies; strategic sustainable development; group model building","SUSTAINABILITY","Watz, M","[Watz, Matilda] Blekinge Inst Technol, Dept Strateg Sustainable Dev, S-37179 Karlskrona, Sweden.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Abd-El-Khalick F, 1998, SCI EDUC, V82, P417, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199807)82:4<417::AID-SCE1>3.0.CO;2-E##Albareda-Tiana S, 2020, WORLD SUSTAIN SER, P193, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-15604-6_13##Andersen DF, 2007, J OPER RES SOC, V58, P691, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602339##Annetta L.

The main purpose of this paper is to explore the current status and problems of implementation of Education for Sustainable Development by examining the sustainability-related knowledge content included in the higher education curriculum, with a special focus on the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). We used both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods, including keyword analysis of selected MOOCs' syllabuses, to capture the nature of the studied phenomenon and enable assessment of the degree to which the sustainable development goals are integrated into the learning content. We found that most of 17 SDGs are reflected in the MOOCs learning content, but in case of some learning topics, such as ""Zero hunger"" and ""Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"", a bigger effort should be made to include them more broadly in the curricula. The research results can support educators' efforts in identifying and incorporating challenging issues within the processes of curriculum development, indicating the need for a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, in which sustainability should be mainstreamed into all aspects of education.","MOOCS","education for sustainable development; massive open online courses; MOOCs; sustainable development goals; course description","SUSTAINABILITY","Hajdukiewicz, A##Pera, B","[Hajdukiewicz, Agnieszka; Pera, Bozena] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Int Trade, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Angiel J, 2015, SUSTAIN DEV, V23, P188, DOI 10.1002/sd.1586##Annan-Diab F, 2017, INT J MANAG EDUC-OXF, V15, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.ijme.2017.03.006##[Anonymous], **NON-TRADITIONAL**##[Anonymous], **NON-TRADITIONAL**##[Anonymous], **NON-TRADITIONAL**##[Anonymous], **NON-TRADITIONAL**##[Anonymous], 2014, IMP REV LEARN OUTC O##[Anonymous], **NON-TRADITIONAL**##[Anonymous], **NON-TRADITIONAL**##[Anonymous], **NON-TRADITIONAL**##Ashford N.A., 2004, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V5, P239, DOI DOI 10.1108/14676370410546394##Bergman Z, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su10124471##Bird E., 2008, UNESCO SERIES JOURNA, V5##Bordoloi R., 2018, ASIAN ASS OPEN U J, V13, P24, DOI [https://doi-org.proxy.library.uu.nl/10.1108/AAOUJ-11-2017-0037, DOI 10.1108/AAOUJ-11-2017-0037]##Cha H., 2010, RADICAL SOLUTIONS OP, P135, DOI [10.1007/978-981-15-4276-3, DOI 10.1007/978-981-15-4276-3]##Disterheft A., 2013, SUSTAINABILITY ASSES, P3, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-02375-5_1##Egana del Sol P.A, 2019, QUALITY ED, P1, DOI [10.1007/978-3-319-69902-8_3-1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-69902-8_3-1]##Filho WL, 2019, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V26, P179, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2018.1505674##Gamage D., 2016, P 10 INT TECHN ED DE##International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural, 1991, UN ENV PROGR WORLD W##Islam M.F., 2019, P W BALK INF MED LIT##Johnston T.

However, research aimed at showing the potential contribution of each platform's business model to sustainable development is needed. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are driving the policy agenda, but it remains unclear how far they encourage a sustainable platform economy. First, this article aims to study how each different type of platform contributes to sustainable development. Second, it analyses if and how the factors that contribute to the sustainable design of platforms are considered in SDGs. The paper departs from a framework of sustainable democratic qualities of the platform economy that considers governance, economic sustainability, technological and data policies, social responsibility, and external impact dimensions. The study is based on an empirical analysis of 60 platforms. The results show that a sustainable design of a platform economy promotes sustainable development. Furthermore, the contributions of the sustainable dimensions of a platform to SDGs are mainly connected to the impact and responsibility and the economic model, but governance and data dimensions are not present in the SDGs. This suggests that SDGs should improve their digital perspective to intertwine better with the sustainable platforms.","SHARING ECONOMY; DESIGN","platform economy; SDGs; sustainable development; agenda 2030; sustainability","SUSTAINABILITY","Morell, MF##Espelt, R##Cano, MR","[Fuster Morell, Mayo] Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

This implies the correlation of the immediate objectives with the long-term ones at local and global level, considering the economic and environmental aspects in close interdependence. Released around 2010, Big Data is a generic term that refers those data sets whose features make it impossible to process with traditional database tools. Beyond the significant dimensions, Big Data is defined by the so-called set of Big Data Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity, volatility and, not least by the value that their analysis adds to the decision-making process. Starting with 2013, the United Nations through the Global Pulse initiative has defined a new concept - Big Data for Development. It aims to find those data sources whose analysis provides valuable information for ensuring the well-being and development of the society. In 2015, the United Nations launched a new agenda that supports 17 sustainable development goals, whose achievement involves integrated actions that will solve social, economic and environmental problems in a way that will reduce disparities. As we are in the middle of the digital revolution, the following question is inevitable: to what extent and in what way can the data collected and analyzed using the latest technologies help to implement policies that will lead to these objectives?

Highly unstable business environments and opportunities occurring in the market require a specific approach and knowledge to achieve success. It is the authors' view that improvements in the delivery of sustainable results through social, environmental, and economic responsibility is possible thanks to modern management concepts, strategies, and tools. These activities and approaches, when properly incorporated, significantly support the functioning of businesses in a responsible and profitable way. This paper outlines a systematic literature review of the subject described above. The literature review has been conducted with the use of two databases: Web of Science and Scopus. The results of the analysis show that there is a visible connection between Operational Excellence and Sustainable Development concepts. On the basis of the review, one can notice a strong relationship between Operational Excellence and management concepts, e.g., Lean Management. Nevertheless, the input of the selected articles based on abstract analysis compared to the whole compilation concerning Sustainable Development shows that there is a gap. The authors believe that this topic is interesting and worth further analysis.","SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGEMENT; BIG DATA; PERFORMANCE; GREEN; LOGISTICS; ANALYTICS; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACTS; GROWTH","sustainable development; sustainable manufacturing; operational excellence; systematic literature review; supply chain management","SUSTAINABILITY","Wojtkowiak, D##Cyplik, P","[Wojtkowiak, Daniel; Cyplik, Piotr] Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Engn Management, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Adams R, 2016, INT J MANAG REV, V18, P180, DOI 10.1111/ijmr.12068##Bergmiller G.G., P 2009 IND ENG RES C##Brundtland G.H., 1985, ENVIRON POLICY LAW, V14, P26, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0378-777X(85)80040-8##Carvalho AM, 2019, TOTAL QUAL MANAG BUS, V30, P1495, DOI 10.1080/14783363.2017.1374833##Cash DW, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P8086, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1231332100##Choudhary S, 2019, PROD PLAN CONTROL, V30, P353, DOI 10.1080/09537287.2018.1501811##Dues CM, 2013, J CLEAN PROD, V40, P93, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.12.023##Elkington J., 1998, ENV QUALITY MANAGEME, V8, P37, DOI [10.1002/tqem.3310080106, DOI 10.1002/TQEM.3310080106]##Fink A, 2005, CONDUCTING RES LIT R##Galeazzo A, 2014, J CLEAN PROD, V85, P191, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.10.015##Garza-Reyes JA, 2018, INT J PROD ECON, V200, P170, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2018.03.030##Godfrey R., 1998, GREENER PURCHASING O, P244##Gossling-Goidsmiths J., 2018, THESIS##Gupta V, 2018, COMPUT OPER RES, V89, P284, DOI 10.1016/j.cor.2017.03.015##Hart S.L., 1996, BUS STRATEG ENVIRON, V5, P30, DOI [DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0836(199603)5:1, 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0836(199603)5]##Hartini S, 2015, PROCEDIA MANUF, V4, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.promfg.2015.11.012##HAWKEN P, 1993, ECOLOGY COMMERCE##Hazen BT, 2014, INT J PROD ECON, V154, P72, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.04.018##Jakhar SK, 2018, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V139, P262, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.08.019##Khan, 2019, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V142, P277, DOI [10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.014, DOI 10.1016/J.RESCONREC.2018.11.014]##Khan SAR, 2017, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V24, P1518, DOI 10.1007/s11356-016-7916-2##Limanond T, 2011, ENERG POLICY, V39, P2754, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.045##Lu DW, 2011, TOTAL QUAL MANAG BUS, V22, P1263, DOI 10.1080/14783363.2011.631336##Luthra S, 2018, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V138, P194, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.07.005##Mensah J, 2019, COGENT SOC SCI, V5, DOI 10.1080/23311886.2019.1653531##MULROW CD, 1994, BRIT MED J, V309, P597, DOI 10.1136/bmj.309.6954.597##NAFTANAILA IR, 2013, STUDIES BUSINESS EC, V8, P133##Norman W, 2004, BUS ETHICS Q, V14, P243, DOI 10.5840/beq200414211##Odwazny F, 2019, LOGFORUM, V15, P237, DOI 10.17270/J.LOG.2019.321##Okoli C., 2010, SSRN ELECT J, P10##Olugu EU, 2011, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V55, P567, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.06.003##Petticrew M, 2006, SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: A PRACTICAL GUIDE, P1, DOI 10.1002/9780470754887##Rai A, 2006, MIS QUART, V30, P225##Rashid SHA, 2008, INT J SUSTAIN ENG, V1, P214, DOI 10.1080/19397030802513836##Rodriguez L, 2018, LOGFORUM, V14, P151, DOI 10.17270/J.LOG.267##Rothenberg S, 2001, PROD OPER MANAG, V10, P228, DOI 10.1111/j.1937-5956.2001.tb00372.x##Salvendy G., 2001, HDB IND ENG TECHNOLO, P5##Shultz CJ, 1999, J PUBLIC POLICY MARK, V18, P218, DOI 10.1177/074391569901800208##Simao LE, 2016, ECOL INDIC, V63, P398, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.10.048##Srivastava SK, 2007, INT J MANAG REV, V9, P53, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2370.2007.00202.x##The U.S. Department of Commerce, SUST MAN IN SMI TRUE##Tranfield D, 2003, BRIT J MANAGE, V14, P207, DOI 10.1111/1467-8551.00375##Treacy M., 1993, HARVARD BUSINESS REV##United Nations, SUST DEV GOALS##Venugopal V, 2019, INT J SUSTAIN ENG, V12, P159, DOI 10.1080/19397038.2019.1566411##Yang CL, 2010, INT J PROD ECON, V123, P210, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2009.08.017##Yu Z, 2018, LOGFORUM, V14, P479, DOI 10.17270/J.LOG.2018.304##Zaman G., 2010, THEORETICAL APPL EC, V12, P5##Zhai TT, 2018, J ENVIRON LAW, V30, P369, DOI 10.1093/jel/eqy011##Zhu QH, 2004, J OPER MANAG, V22, P265, DOI 10.1016/j.jom.2004.01.005",1,"2021-09-03","Poznan University of Technology, Faculty of Engineering Management [0812/SBAD/4178]","COM5","no","SDG.9"

However, there has been a concerted effort by authors to communicate complexity to specialized and wider audiences over the past fifty years. The purpose of this article is to present a taxonomy of visual representations of sustainability and sustainable development that reveal the conceptual diversity and complexity of these metanarratives of the dynamics of socio-ecological systems (SES). Using an exploratory and interpretive methodology, the principal objective is to describe and interpret the core traits of 18 different representations, which reflect the hybrid nature of sustainability and sustainable development depictions, but also allow them to be categorized into six main types. This exercise is based on the review of images used in the secondary literature on sustainability and sustainable development, and also websites that have compiled sets of images. The shared roots or common traits of the six main types are to be found in the principles of complexity, nonlinearity, holism, projection, and praxis. These roots reflect not only the dynamics of SES, but also how these system representations change according to their purposes and etiologies which are, in turn, defined by the academic, public, and private actors who design them.","PICTURES; VALUES","typology; sustainable development; sustainability; communication; visual representation; etiology; systems; complexity","SUSTAINABILITY","Barton, JR##Gutierrez-Antinopai, F","[Barton, Jonathan R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Geog, Santiago 7820436, Chile.

"J","WOS:000587203700001",2020,"Making the Unsustainable Sustainable: How Swedish Secondary School Teachers Deal with Sustainable Development in Their Teaching","The aim of this article is to investigate how Swedish teachers manage the uncertainty and complexity associated with sustainable development (SD) as a field of knowledge, in relation to the requirements in the school curriculum. Underlying the whole concept of sustainable development is the vision that there is a possible solution to the ecological, economic and social problems created by humans. However, it is not so clear what this solution actually means in practice. The article builds on an analysis of transcribed individual and group interviews with 40 teachers at Swedish lower and upper secondary schools, related to the topic of sustainable development as a field of knowledge. A thematic analysis was carried out by identifying four broad themes, including dominating discourses. The results indicate that there is a lack of vision among the teachers for a future sustainable society, while at the same time, it seems to be taboo to talk about what an unsustainable society might mean in the long run. Presentations of the problems and knowledge of what causes them must always be combined with instructions on how problems can be solved and how pupils can influence their own future and help create sustainable development. The starting point for such a solution-oriented approach to SD is based on an assumption that individual behaviour is essential to achieving sustainable development and thus that individual responsibility is crucial. This focus leads to individual consumer choices, behaviours and lifestyles at the heart of teaching, while progressive, alternative visions and critical perspectives are downplayed.","EDUCATION","sustainable development; discourse; future citizens; ecological modernisation","SUSTAINABILITY","Gyberg, P##Anshelm, J##Hallstrom, J","[Gyberg, Per] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.

This protest movement is mainly based on the philosophy of sustainability by promoting the ""slowness"" perspective and the concept of sustainable development at the local level. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impacts of Cittaslow (slow city) philosophy on support for sustainable tourism development in North Cyprus. In this context, this research study is concentrated on the influences of Cittaslow practices on support for sustainable tourism development with dimensions in terms of socio-cultural, economic and ecological aspects. Design/methodology/approach - This study was based on a quantitative research approach to observe the significant effects and meet the objectives. The data were collected randomly by self-administrated questionnaires from residents who are living in the slow cities (Yeni Bogazici, Mehmetcik, Lefke, Gecitkale and Tatlisu) at North Cyprus. Findings - The partial least squares approach to the structural equation model was used to analyze the data. The research results were discussed the critical issues and consequences in the management of slow cities. Originality/value - The slow city concept is a very significant movement that emphasizes the importance of local differences and sustainability. There is a lack of knowledge about the effects of Cittaslow membership and efforts on sustainable tourism development in North Cyprus. The critical factors and implications were pinpointed for enhancing sustainable tourism development in slow cities.","RESIDENTS ATTITUDES; SLOW CITIES; PLS-SEM; SUPPORT; HOSPITALITY; PERCEPTIONS; DESTINATION; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; PLACES","Cittaslow (slow city); Sustainable tourism development; Tourism development; Sustainable city; North Cyprus; Impacts of tourism","OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL","Ince, E##Iscioglu, D##Ozturen, A","[Ince, Ecem; Ozturen, Ali] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Tourism, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Turkey.

Global warming and climate change from human emissions can affect the development of communities including highland communities in Chiang Rai, Thailand in terms of human life, growth and yield of plants and animals. This research presents low-carbon tourism for the sustainable development of the rural highland community in Chiang Rai, Thailand by integrating economic, social and environmental objectives in community development for sustainability. This research is carried out through funding of a royal project and is based on mixed research methodology incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques in different stages including, ethnographic delphi future research, in-depth interview and observation. The study evaluates the community development levels standard and indicators for enhancing the community's economic development such as low carbon tourism development through analyzing the available resources and the Royal Project initiatives through education, meeting and discussion. The result shows its impact on four dimensions of development as 1. environmentally friendly agriculture; 2. forest restoration and conservation; 3. community health management; and 4. community strength to support change, to develop into sustainable low carbon highland communities. The results of this research can be used as a guideline for a sustainable low-carbon community development and also to evaluate criteria, indicators, as well as developmental steps for preparing and evaluating community development levels for certification of community development standards into low-carbon sustainable areas.","DELPHI METHOD; ENERGY USE; CHINA; FOOTPRINT; INDUSTRY; MODEL","Low-carbon tourism; Sustainable development; Community development","ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY","Bhaktikul, K##Aroonsrimorakot, S##Laiphrakpam, M##Paisantanakij, W","[Bhaktikul, Kampanad; Aroonsrimorakot, Sayam] Mahidol Univ, Fac Environm & Resource Studies, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.

Methodology: To analyze the sustainable performance of the Santa Catarina mesoregions, a descriptive, documentary and quali-quantitative research was conducted. The study sample comprised the six mesoregions of the state of Santa Catarina, namely, Serrana, Northern Santa Catarina, Western Santa Catarina, Southern Santa Catarina, Vale do Itajai and Greater Florianopolis. Data from the Municipal Sustainable Development Index-IDMS were collected on the FECAM website and comprise the year 2018. The analysis considered the descriptive statistics and correlation techniques. Results: The results reveal a state formed by 5 mesoregions that have a sustainable performance considered low-median, and 1 mesoregion with a sustainable average performance, which consists of the Vale do Itajai mesoregion whose IDMS was 0.625. This result is generally reflected in the low rates of environmental management, economic dynamism and wealth distribution, demonstrating that the Economic and Environmental dimensions deserve attention from municipal public managers, as they were located between Medium-low and Low sustainable development. Neither of the four dimensions nor the consolidated IDMS of Santa Catarina mesoregions is classified with sustainable performance considered High or Mediumhigh. Overall, there was a slight worsening in the development of the mesoregions between 2016 and 2018. Contributions of the Study: By assessing the sustainable development of the mesoregions, the study contributes to the literature on regional indicator systems and sustainable regional development, allowing the understanding of the sustainable performance process of the municipalities that make up these mesoregions, as well as enabling the monitoring and the comparability of this performance. The study also contributes to the implementation of resultsoriented management, which is the main indication of the new public management, whose emphasis is on the effective use of information.",NA,"Sustainable development; Sustainability Indicators; Mesoregions","REVISTA AMBIENTE CONTABIL","da Silva, LC##da Rosa, FS","[da Silva, Luana Caroline] Univ Fed Santa Catarina Florianopolis, Contabilidade Area Controladoria & Governanca, Rodovia SC 435,360, BR-88150000 Aguas Mornas, SC, Brazil.

This was a sequel to the Millennium Development Goals whose remit ended in 2015. Challenges lie ahead for governments around the world - national, provincial and municipal - to adapt the targets and indicators to effect a meaningful transition towards sustainable development by 2030. Cities are where the battle for sustainable development will be won or lost - they contribute 80% of the global GDP, and account for 70% each of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. With over two-thirds of the global population likely to live in cities by 2060, this is more than a cliche. A clutch of sustainable cities makes a sustainable province; a clutch of sustainable provinces makes a sustainable country, and it follows that several sustainable countries learning and sharing and helping other countries, will make for a sustainable world in the 21st century and further on into the future. While moving forward, trade-offs and complementarities must not be forgotten. Often, there are serendipitous benefits when complementarities which exist are not factored in, but the trade-offs if forgotten may end up robbing Peter to pay Paul. Despite the interregnum brought about by the Corona Virus pandemic in 2020, the world will be getting up, dusting itself clean and moving ahead in the next decade towards the SDGs set for year-2030.",NA,"Sustainable Development Goals; Millennium Development Goals; Targets; Indicators; Urban sustainability","PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU","Venkatesh, G","[Venkatesh, G.] Karlstad Univ, Dept Chem & Engn Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.","Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Allen C, 2018, SUSTAIN SCI, V13, P1453, DOI 10.1007/s11625-018-0572-3##BARTLEBY, 2019, ECONOMIST, P61##CONVENTION FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, 2019, CONV BIOL DIV COLL M##HEEKS R., 2016, 64 DEV INF##Hickel J, 2019, SUSTAIN DEV, V27, P873, DOI 10.1002/sd.1947##Jones P, 2017, INDONES J SUSTAIN AC, V1, P1, DOI 10.28992/ijsam.v1i1.22##Kallio TJ, 2007, SUSTAIN DEV, V15, P41, DOI 10.1002/sd.292##KLOKE-LESCH A., 2018, J INT RELATIONS SUST, V12, P144##LAFORTUNE G., 2019, SDG INDEX DASHBOARD##Lynch A., 2019, 2019 US CITIES SUSTA##Nilsson M, 2016, NATURE, V534, P320, DOI 10.1038/534320a##NITI AAYOG GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, 2018, SDG IND IND BAS REP##Pradhan P, 2017, EARTHS FUTURE, V5, P1169, DOI 10.1002/2017EF000632##Quental N, 2011, SUSTAIN DEV, V19, P15, DOI 10.1002/sd.416##Rockstrom J, 2009, ECOL SOC, V14##SCOTT L., 2018, SDG REPORTING CHALLE##SSE UK, 2018, CREAT VAL SUST WAY S##Steffen W, 2015, SCIENCE, V347, DOI 10.1126/science.1259855##THE ECONOMIST, 2019, ECONOMIST       0921, P27##THE ECONOMIST, 2019, ECONOMIST       1019##THE ECONOMIST, 2019, ECONOMIST       1130, P57##WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, 2018, CHEM SECT SDG ROADM##WRIGHT H., 2016, IMPACT CLIMATE CHANG##Zinkernagel R, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su10093201##ZONDERVAN R, 2017, ENV SCI, V26, P34",0,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM4","no","SDG.11#SDG.7"
"J","WOS:000594582100001",2020,"Systemic Sustainable Development in the Transport Service Sector","The concept of sustainability and sustainable development, especially systemic sustainable development, still raises controversy in literature. The article makes an attempt to re-examine these concepts from a systems perspective, seeking foundations and applications in the selected sector. It is becoming increasingly clear that sustainability and sustainable development are aimed at integrated economic, social, cultural, political, and ecological factors. This causes a need for a constructive approach to the issue, taking into account all the actors, areas and dimensions involved in the pursuit of systemic sustainable development. As a result, both local and global dimensions and the way they interact must be explored in a multifaceted manner in order to offer a perspective more effective and useful than other analytical approaches, as the systems view is a way of thinking in terms of connectedness, relationships, and context. The article aims to review selected publications and studies so as to form the general idea of systemic sustainable development and define the systemic development of sustainable transport, including in particular the perspective of the actors of the sector, transport providers (passenger, urban), and transport development program, implemented both by local governments and on the European scale. An attempt was made to identify elements of the systemic sustainable development model, setting it in the reality of the following subcategories: ""Society"", ""Economy"", and ""Environment"" in sectoral terms. It is supposed that systemic sustainable development is a conglomerate of public administration entities, companies operating in the sector, individual and corporate customers, acting in certain conditions for economic, social, and environmental well-being, and a number of their initiatives of major or minor significance, grouped in six sub-areas, undertaken to achieve systemic value in the examined sector, with a positive or negative business/economic, social, and environmental impact.",NA,"sustainable development; systemic development; systemic sustainable transport development","SUSTAINABILITY","Sztangret, I","[Sztangret, Izabela] Univ Econ Katowice, Entrepreneurship Dept, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","abiski L., 2010, MARKETING SYSTEMIC P##[Anonymous], 2000, WHITE PAPER 4 RATION##[Anonymous], LEKS TRANSP WYD##[Anonymous], EUR EC SOC COMM COMM##[Anonymous], WHIT PAP ROADM SING##Banister D, 2008, TRANSPORT POLICY, V15, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.10.005##Bawat D., TRANSPORT INTERMODAL##Borys T., 2014, LOGISTYKA, V3, P7254##Ciegis R, 2009, ENG ECON, V62, P2##Cruz I, 2009, ECOL ECON, V68, P2021, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004##De Flander K, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/su9010099##Ehrenfeld J.R., 2008, SUSTAINABILITY DESIG##Europe, 2020, EUROP 2020 FLAGSH IN##Europe 2020, 2020, STRATEGY SMART SUSTA, P5##Feitelson E, 2002, TRANSPORT RES D-TR E, V7, P99, DOI 10.1016/S1361-9209(01)00013-X##Gallopin G, 2003, SYSTEMS APPROACH SUS##Gerwin M., PLAN ZROWNOWAONEGO R##Kates RW, 2001, SCIENCE, V292, P641, DOI 10.1126/science.1059386##Kieczewski D., EKOLOGICZNE PROBLEMY##Kolak A., 2008, INTELIGENTNE SYSTEMY##Kozowski S., 2005, PRZYSZO EKOROZWOJU F##Motowidlak U., 2017, ZESZYTY NAUKOWE UNIW, V337##Pezzey J.C.V., 2002, REV J ARTIC, DOI [10.4324/9781315240084, DOI 10.4324/9781315240084]##Sala S, 2015, ECOL ECON, V119, P314, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.09.015##Seidler R., 2019, DIMENSIONS SUSTAINAB##Spruill N., 2001, NATL CIVIC REV, V90, P105, DOI [10.1002/ncr.90110, DOI 10.1002/NCR.90110]##Stappen R., 2006, RAPORT BRUNDTLAND##UNCED United Nations Convention on Environment and Development, 1992, AG 21##Werbach A., 2008, STRATEGY SUSTAINABIL##Zaremba P., 2018, LAW ELECTROMOBILITY, V17, P317",2,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM13","no","SDG.8#SDG.11"

However, further research is needed to explore how ISO standards can serve as a platform for achieving the SDGs. In this paper, we discuss the interlinkage between ISO standards and SDG 2 (i.e., Zero hunger-End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture). We review the literature on a set of 77 ISO standards related to SDG 2 and study existing evidence pertinent to SDG 2 and its targets. Specifically, we review research in four key areas of interest: agricultural productivity of ISO certified firms, adoption of ISO standards amongst small scale producers, ISO standards development, and governance of standards. We found implicit evidence in the literature that ISO standards have the potential to contribute to two SDG 2 targets, namely targets 2.3 and 2.4. Some aspects of ISO standards, however, such as low levels of adoption amongst small scale farmers or a lack of multi-stakeholder standard development, contradict key aspects of the SDG agenda. We outline key areas for future research in the four areas of interest noted above.","SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; ISO-9000; IMPLEMENTATION; QUALITY; FOOD; CERTIFICATION; DIFFICULTIES; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE","ISO; standards; sustainable development goals; SDG 2; sustainable development","SUSTAINABILITY","Zhao, XL##Castka, P##Searcy, C","[Zhao, Xiaoli; Castka, Pavel] Univ Canterbury, UC Business Sch, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand.

"J","WOS:000601162800006",2021,"Modeling interlinkages between sustainable development goals using network analysis","Universal, ambitious, and arguably ambiguous, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are difficult to measure, monitor, prioritize and achieve. They are a multi-dimensional construct of economic, social and environmental indicators that work through complex interlinkages. We investigate these interlinkages at the SDG target level to identify the trade-offs and synergies between the SDGs. Second, we identify the community of interlinked SDG targets to determine if the SDGs can be benchmarked and prioritized for different regions. Employing network analysis approach the analysis is based on the IAEG-SDG data for the period 2000-2017. We find several positive and negative interlinkages (reinforcing and balancing feedbacks) between the SDG targets. The trade-offs, however, are much weaker than the synergies. Analyzing network structures for different regions, our results suggest that universal benchmarking of SDGs is counterproductive. We argue that it may be useful to identify a specific community of SDG targets, and use them as a guide to prioritize certain goals in different regions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Through a case study of the Central African Copperbelt countries of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, energy efficiency opportunities in copper operations and environmental impact of metal extraction are evaluated qualitatively, characterized, and quantified using principles of industrial ecology, life cycle assessment, and engineering economics. In these countries the mining sector is the greatest consumer of electricity, accounting for about 53.6% in the region. Energy efficiency improvements in the refinery processes is shown to have a factor of two improvement potential. Further, four strategies are identified by which the mining and technology industries can enhance sustainable electricity generation capacity: energy efficiency; use of solar and other renewable resources; share expertise from the mining and technology industries within the region; and take advantage of the abundant cobalt and other raw materials to initiate value-added manufacturing.","RENEWABLE ENERGY; SYSTEM","copper; cobalt; mining; sustainable energy development; engineering economics; multi-national enterprises","SUSTAINABILITY","Imasiku, K##Thomas, VM","[Imasiku, Katundu] Univ Rwanda, African Ctr Excellence Energy Sustainable Dev, Kigali 4285, Rwanda.

"J","WOS:000604547200004",2021,"Sustainable product development processes in fashion: Supply chains structures and classifications","Product development is a critical part of all business operations. In fashion apparel, product development is a complicated process. In recent years, with the advance of technologies and the growing public awareness of environmental protection, product development processes (PDPs) in supply chains, including fashion supply chains, need to be environmentally sustainable. In this paper, we first identify the commonly seen supply chain structures in the fashion industry. Then, by examining the product development process in practice and in the literature, we identify the essential steps in fashion PDPs, which include planning, product design, manufacturing, and product launching. We further classify the product development process into three types, namely the traditional product development process (TPDP), new product development process (NPDP), and sustainable product development process (SPDP). Furthermore, we analyze the key factors of achieving sustainable fashion based on the triple bottom line (TBL) framework regarding the PDP. We establish a sustainable product development process (SPDP) matrix, which can guide the fashion supply chain members to operate in a sustainable manner during the SPDP. Finally, we reveal open research issues and propose a future research agenda.","RETAIL; DESIGN; GREEN; MODEL; STRATEGY; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; SERVICES; INDUSTRY","Sustainable product development; Supply chain structuresl classifications; Product development processes; Sustainable production","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS","Fung, YN##Chan, HL##Choi, TM##Liu, R","[Fung, Yi-Ning; Choi, Tsan-Ming; Liu, Rong] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

The statistical evaluation of this complex phenomenon was based on 108 statistical indicators describing 17 goals of sustainable development which were taken from the Eurostat database. The statistical data applies mostly to the year 2018. The zero unitarization method was applied as a research tool. Passing through consecutive stages, the values of synthetic measures with variables determining the subsequent goals of sustainable development were set. Our study led to the ranking of EU countries into groups of high, medium-high, medium-low and low level of sustainable development. The results confirmed that the leaders of sustainable development in the EU are Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Austria. Most EU countries have reached the medium level, while Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus have poorly realized the goals of sustainable development. Due to the growing importance of countries of the Visegrad group in Europe, this article also subjected them to a more detailed assessment in terms of their sustainable development. Among the Visegrad countries, only the Czech Republic has reached a medium-high level of sustainable development. The other three countries, i. e. Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, hold a similar position in the ranking of EU countries in terms of sustainable development. Considering future generations, the implementation of the goals of sustainable development as well as the identification of key indicators for each country are becoming an important challenge in terms of global market competitiveness.","SOCIOECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; EU COUNTRIES; COMPETITIVENESS; REALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; STRATEGY","sustainable development; challenges to sustainable competitiveness; a multidimensional comparative analysis; synthetic measure","JOURNAL OF COMPETITIVENESS","Kiselakova, D##Stec, M##Grzebyk, M##Sofrankova, B","[Kiselakova, Dana; Sofrankova, Beata] Univ Presov Presov, Fac Management, Dept Finance, Presov, Slovakia.

The report Scaling Finance for the Sustainable Development Goals highlighted the urgency of the efforts to realize SDGs in encouraging financial innovation to move quickly. Even if the role of finance in achieving SDGs is unquestionable, few scientific studies have addressed these issues. We tried to fill the existing research gap. In this study, we examined the link between sustainable finance and SDGs based on European Union countries belonging to the OECD. We present a new and the original research approach. We assumed that the sustainable finance model plays a fundamental role in implementing SDGs (all SDGs were analysed except for SDG 6 and SDG14, due to lack of statistics were not analysed) and ensuring that social and environmental sustainability are reflected in SDGs. The results of this study show that the more sustainable the finance model, the better the achievement of SDGs in the group of analysed countries. We found a strong link between sustainable finance model and social sustainability (SDG1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16); environmental sustainability (SDG11, 12, 13, 15) and economic sustainability (SDG8, 9, 17).","RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CARBON EMISSIONS; SDGS; ENVIRONMENT; MODELS; IMPACT; TAX","sustainable development goals; SDGs; Agenda 2030; sustainable finance model; the correspondence analysis","TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY","Ziolo, M##Bak, I##Cheba, K","[Ziolo, Magdalena] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ Finance & Management, Szczecin, Poland.

Labelled by some as the ""third pillar"" of the international climate regime-along with mitigation and adaptation-it has been suggested that loss and damage has the potential to catalyze important synergies with other international agendas, particularly sustainable development. However, the specific approaches to sustainable development that inform loss and damage research and how these approaches influence research outcomes and policy recommendations remain largely unexplored. We offer a systematic analysis of the assumptions of sustainable development that underpins loss and damage scholarship through a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed research on loss and damage. We demonstrate that the use of specific metrics, decision criteria, and policy prescriptions by loss and damage researchers and practitioners implies an unwitting adherence to different underlying theories of sustainable development, which in turn impact how loss and damage is conceptualized and applied. In addition to research and policy implications, our review suggests that assumptions about the aims of sustainable development determine how loss and damage is conceptualized, measured, and governed, and the human development approach currently represents the most advanced perspective on sustainable development and thus loss and damage. This review supports sustainable development as a coherent, comprehensive, and integrative framework for guiding further conceptual and empirical development of loss and damage scholarship.",NA,"Loss and damage; Climate change; Sustainable development; Capital theory; Human development","CLIMATIC CHANGE","Boda, CS##Faran, T##Scown, M##Dorkenoo, K##Chaffin, BC##Nastar, M##Boyd, E","[Boda, Chad S.; Faran, Turaj; Dorkenoo, Kelly; Nastar, Maryam; Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Lund, Sweden.

To achieve this, the authors relied on the concepts of sustainable local development, social capital, the relationship between sectors or intersectorality, networks and interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary knowledge. Regarding the methodology, the abductive method was used. Under a documentary design, the research techniques were a content analysis of theoretical documents and the deductive inference technique. The construction of a knowledge exchange network for sustainable local development stands out as the result.

To understand the nature of firms that can respond better to uncertainty in their sustainable development practices, this study defines sustainable development flexibility and investigates the mechanism underlying its formation. The study proposes a conceptual framework on the interactions of managers' environmental attitude and cognitive style, as well as firms' information integration on sustainable development flexibility. A questionnaire survey was developed to test the corresponding hypotheses, and 241 valid responses were received from middle- and top-level managers in Chinese firms. The results show that (a) the higher the manager's environmental attitude, the higher the firm's information integration and greater sustainable supply chain flexibility, and (b) the more intuitive the manager's cognitive style, the greater the impact of environmental attitude on sustainable development flexibility.",NA,"cognitive style; environmental attitude; flexibility; information integration; sustainable development","BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT","Yu, KK##Qian, C##Zhang, LB","[Yu, Kangkang; Zhang, Lingbo] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.

The extent to which countries succeed in reconciling these goals is context specific but depends largely on how we organize society and on what policy options and strategies we use. We present a model for sustainable development consisting of six indicators and assign thresholds that define a sustainable development space. The distances between the indicator values and their corresponding thresholds constitute the sustainable development gap. We then apply a cluster analysis technique to group 117 countries into six clusters that face similar challenges in closing this gap. Finally, we use illustrative spider web diagrams to assess the performance of these clusters at two points in time. We show that some countries have clearly been better than others at reconciling these goals, and many have reduced their sustainable development gap over time.",NA,"environmental policy; indicators; just operating space; sustainable development goals; sustainable development space; trade&#8208; offs and synergies","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Linnerud, K##Holden, E##Simonsen, M","[Linnerud, Kristin; Simonsen, Morten] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Engn & Sci, Bergen, Norway.

"J","WOS:000618852700007",2020,"Constitution and Sustainable Development","In the legal framework, sustainable development as a concept was firstly used and elaborated upon in international law. The concept has generally been treated as a matter of soft law by international instruments. However there is also non-negligible number of hard law documents that regulate specific elements of sustainable development. The concept had begun to find its place in the constitutions by the late 1980's. In fact, the issues that the concept of sustainable development refers to were already regulated by national constitutions. However, the concept of sustainable development brought up a meaning different to that which was regulated by the constitution before. Sustainable development changes the way people relate to other people, society and the state. This shift can be observed by analysing the rights, duties and obligations that the concept imposes. This shift caused a transformative effect on constitutionalism's old model of relationships based entirely on the state-individual dichotomy. This dichotomy functions when the primordial aim of constitutionalism is considered as the limitation of government authority for the protection of constitutional rights of the individuals. However the function of constitutionalism is no longer limited to this unequal relationship. The concept reconstructs and diversifies the functions of constitutionalism by perpetuating the conception of ""common survival in the planet"". This conception requires more responsible citizens and much more responsible enterprises. The state is no longer the sole debtor of the constitution. Sustainable development imposes a privatization of constitutional relations. Despite the absence of the concept in the wording of the Turkish Constitution of 1982, Constitution refers systematically to the three pillars of sustainable development. The Constitution envisaged development plans as to the effective realisation and integration of the three pillars of sustainability.",NA,"Constitution; Sustainable development; Soft law; Environment; Social justice; Economic development; Intergenerational justice; Intra-Generational justice; Solidarity","ISTANBUL HUKUK MECMUASI","Boyar, O","[Boyar, Oya] Marmara Univ, Hukuk Fak, Anayasa Hukuku Anabilim Dali, Istanbul, Turkey.","Law","Government & Law","Agius E, 2009, FUTURE GENERATIONS I##Barral V, 2012, EUR J INT LAW, V23, P377, DOI 10.1093/ejil/chs016##Baxter R.

"J","WOS:000618937200006",2021,"Development of Sustainable Community-Based Tourism in Kampong Grangsil, Jambangan Village, Dampit District, Malang Regency","This discussion aims to find a sustainable community-based development model through a multi-stakeholder participatory approach. Rural planning in Indonesia has undergone significant changes in the last decade. Community-based development and participation is now an established agricultural development planning policy. Community participation produces planning and design decisions based on community needs, priorities, and affordability which often results in better and more realistic designs, plans, and programmes. In the development of kampung tourism, implementing community participation can reduce cost, increase the use of local resources, and socially empower the community. Kampong Grangsil is a hamlet of hardworking and civic-minded flower farmers. These farmers and members of their community organized and developed their village into a tourism destination that they named Kampoeng Boenga Grangsil (KBG) - Grangsil Flower Village. The high level of community participation as well as a Villages Partner Development Programme, made possible through the collaboration of village governments and university research teams, succeeded in making KBG into what it is today. Mentoring, through in-situ assistance (in Grangsil) and ex-situ assistance (at the Campus and Woodcraft Gallery), was carried out to strengthen resources. Throughout the mentoring programme, the research team acted as both a mediator and facilitator for developing Grangsil into an environmentally-friendly tourism destination. The role and involvement of mediators in the participatory development process increased the ability of communities to organize and build sustainable villages.","RURAL TOURISM; PERCEPTIONS; EMPOWERMENT","Sustainable Community; Community-Based Development; Sustainable Tourism Development","INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Wikantiyoso, R##Cahyaningsih, DS##Sulaksono, AG##Widayati, S##Poerwoningsih, D##Triyosoputri, E","[Wikantiyoso, Respati; Poerwoningsih, Dina; Triyosoputri, Etikawati] Univ Merdeka Malang, Dept Architecture, Malang, Indonesia.

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 from Agenda 2030 is focused on education including university. In addition, higher education has a central role in delivering a number of the other SDGs. The universities become a role model of sustainable development and environmental protection behavior and practices. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between environmental attitude and behavior of university students and their care and participation in and for environmental development. A total of 2038 students enrolled at Afyon Kocatepe University Turkey and Cluj Napoca University Romania participated in this survey. It was revealed that the students' environmental attitude and behavior are similar, but there are also some differences due to the cross-culture environmental education. The vision of universities regarding the future for sustainable environment envisages the development of students' care, stimulation and participation in and for the environment.","ATTITUDES","cross-culture; environmental attitude; environmental behavior; sustainable development","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL","Saracli, S##Boca, GD","[Saracli, Sinan] Afton Kocatepe Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Stat, ANS Campus, TR-03200 Afyon, Turkey.

A sustainable development strategy can serve as a political control instrument and management tool. For the development and implementation of such a strategy at the local level, municipalities might use citizen participation approaches. There exist manifold ways of consulting civil society, representing different levels of decision-making power. The analysis of this article is divided into two parts. First, we report on a case study of the pilot project ""Global Sustainable Municipalities"" located in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and assess the current status of the use of citizen participation formats for adopting a local sustainable development strategy. Second, we developed a model of citizen participation approaches during different phases of adopting a sustainable development strategy. The purpose of this model is to assess the potential decision-making power of citizens during the phases and to help municipalities to get an orientation on participation possibilities. The results show that most municipalities count on participation mainly in the implementation phase of the strategy, less during developing it. Our model, however, demonstrates participation possibilities for each of the phases.","DEVELOPMENT GOALS; FUTURE; ORGANIZATIONS; CONTRIBUTE; CITIES","citizen participation; decision-making; Germany; smart sustainable municipalities; sustainable development goals; sustainable development strategy","URBAN SCIENCE","Meschede, C##Mainka, A","[Meschede, Christine; Mainka, Agnes] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Informat Sci, D-40223 Dusseldorf, Germany.","Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies","Abel TD, 2000, AM BEHAV SCI, V44, P614, DOI 10.1177/00027640021956413##Andersen IE., 1999, SCI PUBL POLICY, V26, P331, DOI DOI 10.3152/147154399781782301##ARNSTEIN SR, 1969, J AM I PLANNERS, V35, P216, DOI 10.1080/01944366908977225##Bibri SE, 2017, SUSTAIN CITIES SOC, V31, P183, DOI 10.1016/j.scs.2017.02.016##Bond S, 2007, PLAN THEORY PRACT, V8, P449, DOI 10.1080/14649350701664689##Brady Henry E., 2003, BROOKINGS REV, V21, P16##Brunkhorst S., 2017, GLOBAL POLICY FORUM, V1, P1##Corbett J, 2017, INFORM SYST J, V27, P427, DOI 10.1111/isj.12138##Dennerlein S, 2015, PROC EUR CONF KNOWL, P222##Eckerberg K., 2003, LOCAL ENVIRON, V8, P591, DOI [DOI 10.1080/1354983032000152716, 10.1080/1354983032000152716]##Fox O, 2016, GLOBAL GOV, V22, P555, DOI 10.1163/19426720-02204007##Gabriel O.W., 2018, NEW POLITICAL CULTUR, P219##Gastil J, 1999, POLIT COMMUN, V16, P3, DOI 10.1080/105846099198749##Goodin RE, 2006, POLIT SOC, V34, P219, DOI 10.1177/0032329206288152##Hawkins CV, 2012, PUBLIC WORKS MANAG P, V17, P7, DOI 10.1177/1087724X11429045##Herrington N., 2006, MANAGEMENT ED, V20, P13##Howard J, 2015, COMMUNITY DEV J, V50, P552, DOI 10.1093/cdj/bsv033##Hunsberger CA, 2005, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, V25, P609, DOI 10.1016/j.eiar.2004.12.003##Irvin RA, 2004, PUBLIC ADMIN REV, V64, P55, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00346.x##Klopp JM, 2017, CITIES, V63, P92, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2016.12.019##Krippendorff K., 2018, CONTENT ANAL INTRO I, V4th ed##LAG 21 NRW; SKEW, 2018, GLOB NACHH KOMM NRW, P111##Lent R.

Thus, the present research work constructs the sustainable development index for BRI. Afterwards, it unfolds the nexus of sustainable development-environmental degradation and also evaluates the role of financial development indicators in BRI economies. By utilizing the robust mean group, the present study quantifies the long-run marginal impacts of sustainable development, financial development indicators, energy consumption, and urban sprawl on environmental degradation, respectively. The marginal impacts infer an inverted U-shaped sustainable development environmental Kuznets curve in BRI region. The sustainable development, energy consumption, and urban sprawl are enriching the environmental degradation, whereas the financial development indicators have an adverse impact on environmental degradation by induction of interaction of sustainable development-financial development. Therefore, the improvements in financial development indicators will help to achieve the sustainable development.",NA,"One Belt and Road Initiative; Financial development; Environmental Kuznets curve; Environmental degradation; Sustainable development; Urban sprawl","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","Li, XL##Yu, ZY##Salman, A##Ali, Q##Hafeez, M##Aslam, MS","[Li, Xiaolong] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Modern Post, 10 Xitucheng Haidian Dist, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.

To do so, first a literature review and qualitative research (involving 23 interviews) led to developing a questionnaire, which was then validated. Next, quantitative research involved collecting data from 220 family farmers in Brazil, and exploratory factor analysis was performed. This made it possible to understand how Brazilian family farmers perceived sustainable development in agriculture. This can be measured by 25 variables and 3 factors: natural agriculture; innovation and technology; and environmental aspects. The ante-cedents (predictors) of sustainable development in agriculture were grouped in 5 factors: external influencers; engagement with sustainability; concern about future generations; environmental motivators; and individual characteristics. Two factors (lack of information and knowledge; and lack of planning and support), defined the barriers to sustainable development in agriculture. Socio-environmental benefits and subjective well-being were the two factors measuring the consequences of that development. This article contributes to identifying the factors underlying sustainable development in agriculture, the antecedents, barriers and consequences of that sus-tainability, something as yet not identified in the literature on this subject, which indicates the innovation and originality of the study.",NA,"Sustainable development; Sustainability; Family agriculture; Sustainable agriculture","ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT","Laurett, R##Paco, A##Mainardes, EW","[Laurett, Rozelia; Mainardes, Emerson Wagner] FUCAPE Business Sch, Vitoria, ES, Brazil.

"J","WOS:000630392200001",2021,"Development and validation of an instrument for measuring action competence in sustainable development within early adolescents: the action competence in sustainable development questionnaire (ACiSD-Q)","Action competence consists of the knowledge, willingness, and self-efficacy for contributing to a controversial issue such as sustainable development. As such, action competence in sustainable development (ACiSD) is a desired outcome of education for sustainable development (ESD). Still, the scarce instruments for measuring ACiSD that have been developed to date, are not specifically designed for early adolescence, when civic involvement is developed. Therefore, this study reports on the development of such a measurement instrument: the Action Competence in Sustainable Development Questionnaire (ACiSD-Q). A mixed-method approach in four steps used three different samples: after a literature review (step 1), early adolescents (n = 75) informed the generation of an initial item pool (step 2; qualitative). After assessment of the scale's content validity it was administered to a second sample (n = 403) to test psychometric properties (step 3; quantitative). Finally, rigorous statistical analyses (third sample, n = 1796) confirmed the proposed structure, reliability, construct, and predictive validity of the final ACiSD-Q (step 4; quantitative). Our findings support a valid and reliable third-order model, fit for monitoring ESD efforts that aim to enhance early adolescents' action competence in sustainable development.",NA,"Action competence; sustainable behavior; validation; action competence in sustainable development questionnaire (ACiSD-Q); early adolescents","ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH","Sass, W##Boeve-de Pauw, J##De Maeyer, S##Van Petegem, P","[Sass, Wanda; Boeve-de Pauw, Jelle; De Maeyer, Sven; Van Petegem, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Training & Educ Sci, Res Unit Edubron, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.","Education & Educational Research; Environmental Studies","Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Anderson L.W., 2001, TAXONOMY LEARNING TE##[Anonymous], 2015, TRANSFORMING OUR WOR##Audigier F, 2000, PROJECT ED DEMOCRATI##Berglund T, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su10082738##Berglund T, 2014, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V32, P318, DOI 10.1080/02635143.2014.944493##Boeve -de Pauw J, 2020, CONCEPTUALIZING ENV, P69, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-20249-1##Boeve-de Pauw J, 2015, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V7, P15693, DOI 10.3390/su71115693##Braun V., 2006, QUALITATIVE RES PSYC, V3, P77, DOI [DOI 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa, 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa, DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP063OA]##Breiting S., 1999, CAMB J EDUC, V29, P349, DOI 10.1080/0305764990290305##Brown T., 2006, CONFIRMATORY FACTOR##BURA A, 2001, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V52##BURA A, 1977, PSYCHOL REV, V84##Chawla L., 2009, J DEV PROCESS, V4, P6##Chawla L., 2007, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V13, P437, DOI DOI 10.1080/13504620701581539##Cincera J, 2013, J CLEAN PROD, V61, P117, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.06.030##Cohen L., 2011, RES METHODS ED##DeVellis R.F., 2017, APPL SOCIAL RES METH, V26##Eames C, 2008, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V14, P35, DOI 10.1080/13504620701843343##Ellis G, 2008, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V14, P482, DOI 10.1080/13504620802308287##European Network for Environmental Citizenship.

"J","WOS:000632278600003",2021,"Sustainable energy development: History of the concept and emerging themes","Sustainable energy development is a complex multi-dimensional concept that can vary in meaning based on the context it is applied in and the perspective of the user. The role of energy in achieving sustainable development was recognized when the concept was first put forward in 1987. However, what that role consisted of was not made clear. Since then, the concept of sustainable energy development has developed to become a prominent policy objective on the international agenda, as evidenced by the introduction of the UN?s Sustainable Devel-opment Goal 7 on energy. This paper presents an overview of the history of the concept as well as its emerging themes. Through a citation analysis, the most cited open-access publications relevant to the concept were identified. A thematic analysis of these most cited publications led to the identification of four interrelated themes of sustainable energy development; access to affordable modern energy services, sustainable energy supply, sustainable energy consumption, and energy security. The overarching goal of sustainable energy development was defined as furthering sustainability. Equitable access to affordable and reliable modern energy services is integral to sustainable development. A transformation of the current energy system is necessary to reduce its harmful impacts, both on the supply and demand side. This transformation is not possible unless it is economically viable through, for instance, cost-competitive technologies and changes in energy pricing to reflect the external costs of energy.",NA,"Sustainable energy development; Energy policy; Sustainable development; Literature review; Thematic analysis; Citation analysis","RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS","Gunnarsdottir, I##Davidsdottir, B##Worrell, E##Sigurgeirsdottir, S","[Gunnarsdottir, I; Davidsdottir, B.] Univ Iceland, Environm & Nat Resources, Saemundargotu 2, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.

The needs for transport development in post-socialist countries are so high that it is difficult to finance them, and most governments have to choose between immediate and less urgent needs. The aim of this study was to determine the role played by sustainable transport growth in the improvement of regional cohesion and sustainable regional development with a use of geographical information systems' capabilities. The specific goals of the study were to: (i) determine the impact of EU subsidies on the regional transport development; (ii) identify threats to regional cohesion resulting from under-capitalised regions, (iii) examine geographical information systems' capabilities in periodical regional transport development monitoring. The analyses include evaluation of the regions' involvement in sustainable transport development as well as the presentation of direct and indirect results, such as road system improvement, with the use of GIS capabilities. It is particularly important to develop a system for monitoring the level of EU fund allocation with the use of GIS tools and the capabilities of geographic information systems. Such in-depth analysis would be useful for regional governments and decision-makers in creating and updating long term transport policies as well as monitoring long term regional development strategies. Both sustainable transport development and EU fund allocation can be monitored within the use of GIS tools, and such analyses should supplement the INSPIRE Geoportal scope.",NA,"road network; sustainable development; transport policy; EU funds; INSPIRE Geoportal","ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION","Ogryzek, M##Wolny-Kucinska, A","[Ogryzek, Marek; Wolny-Kucinska, Ada] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Inst Land Management & Geog, Fac Geoengn, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.","Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing","Computer Science; Physical Geography; Remote Sensing","[Anonymous], STRATEGIA ROZWOJU WO##[Anonymous], 2006, POL TRANSP PANSTW LA##[Anonymous], 10 T PROJECTS##[Anonymous], 2020, STRATEGIA ROZWOJU WO##[Anonymous], THE 17 GOALS Sustainable Development##Bachok S, 2014, PROCD SOC BEHV, V153, P553, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.10.088##Boers B., 2007, Tourism Geographies, V9, P1, DOI 10.1080/14616680601092824##Busscher T, 2015, TRANSPORT POLICY, V42, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.04.007##Chen J, 2013, INT ARCH PHOTOGRAMM, V40-4-W3, P47, DOI 10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-4-W3-47-2013##Chen ZH, 2017, J TRANSP GEOGR, V65, P80, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.08.003##Crescenzi R, 2016, J REGIONAL SCI, V56, P555, DOI 10.1111/jors.12264##European Commission, 2011, DIR GEN MOB TRANSP W##Fedonenko YP, 2002, CARBOHYD RES, V337, P869, DOI 10.1016/S0008-6215(02)00061-7##Griskeviciute-Geciene A, 2016, PROCEDIA ENGINEER, V134, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.proeng.2016.01.062##Hertel T, 2010, BE J ECON ANAL POLI, V10##Iacono M, 2016, TRANSPORT POLICY, V45, P209, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.06.005##Jamroz K, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11040959##Knowles RD, 2012, J TRANSP GEOGR, V22, P251, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2012.01.009##Kocur-Bera K, 2019, GEOD CARTOGR, V68, P283, DOI 10.24425/gac.2019.128469##Krakowiak-Bal A., 2005, INFRASTRUKTURA EKOLO, P71##Lella J, 2017, SUSTAIN CITIES SOC, V35, P336, DOI 10.1016/j.scs.2017.08.023##Li T, 2016, TRANSPORT POLICY, V45, P66, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.09.005##Lopez E, 2008, EUR PLAN STUD, V16, P277, DOI 10.1080/09654310701814629##Marin G, 2015, PROC ECON FINANC, V32, P657, DOI 10.1016/S2212-5671(15)01446-X##Goncalves JAM, 2009, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V43, P13, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2008.06.010##Masarova J, 2016, BULL GEOGR SOCIO-ECO, V33, P79, DOI 10.1515/bog-2016-0026##Nellthorp J, 2017, TRANSPORT PROJECTS##Ogryzek M, 2016, ROLA UNIJNYCH FUNDUS##Ogryzek M, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/su12198274##Ogryzek M, 2018, CIV ENVIRON ENG REP, V28, P85, DOI 10.2478/ceer-2018-0021##Olsson J, 2009, J TRANSP GEOGR, V17, P476, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.09.001##Paslawski J, 2006, WPROWADZENIE KARTOGR##Pilla F, 2015, SUSTAIN CITIES SOC, V15, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.scs.2014.10.005##Ribeiro A, 2010, J TRANSP GEOGR, V18, P125, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2009.03.002##Richardson B.

"J","WOS:000635669500001",2021,"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Transformative Change through the Sustainable Development Goals?","The 2030 Agenda of the United Nations comprises 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 sub-targets which serve as a global reference point for the transition to sustainability. The agenda acknowledges that different issues such as poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, environmental degradation, among others, are intertwined and can therefore only be addressed together. Implementing the SDGs as an 'indivisible whole' represents the actual litmus test for the success of the 2030 Agenda. The main challenge is accomplishing a more integrated approach to sustainable development that encompasses new governance frameworks for enabling and managing systemic transformations. This thematic issue addresses the question whether and how the SDGs set off processes of societal transformation, for which cooperation between state and non-state actors at all political levels (global, regional, national, sub-national), in different societal spheres (politics, society, and economy), and across various sectors (energy, transportation, food, etc.) are indispensable. In this editorial, we first introduce the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs by providing an overview of the architecture of the agenda and the key challenges of the current implementation phase. In a second step, we present the eleven contributions that make up the thematic issue clustering them around three themes: integration, governance challenges, and implementation.",NA,"2030 Agenda; governance; implementation; integration; Sustainable Development Goals; sustainability; transformation; transition; United Nations","POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE","Weiland, S##Hickmann, T##Lederer, M##Marquardt, J##Schwindenhammer, S","[Weiland, Sabine] Lille Catholic Univ, European Sch Polit & Social Sci, F-59000 Lille, France.

The VSI published both high quality review papers and original research articles presented at SDEWES 2019 that were of relevance to RSER. A total of 38 articles from the SDEWES 2019 were invited by the guest editors for this VSI. After a scrutinizing peer review process, 28 articles were accepted and published. These articles fall into three broad categories, dealing with smart energy communities, bioenergy and solutions for sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, and produce knowledge relevant to a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This editorial discusses the contributions of the articles relevant for expanding the knowledge on the use of demand side flexibility, advancing the three visions of the bioeconomy, moving forward on the difficult challenges for a sustainable energy system and developing effective tools and guidelines for policy makers. Also, the editorial identifies synergies and trade-offs with a number of SDGs, confirming that the generated knowledge is a valuable support to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.","POWER-TO-GAS; RENEWABLE ENERGY; SMART ENERGY; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; DEMAND RESPONSE; INTEGRATION; BIOENERGY; AMMONIA; FLEXIBILITY","Bioeconomy; Decarbonization; Smart communities; Sustainable development goals; 2030 agenda; Synergies; Trade-offs","RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS","Gjorgievski, VZ##Markovska, N##Puksek, T##Duic, N##Foley, A","[Gjorgievski, Vladimir Z.] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Skopje, North Macedonia.

"J","WOS:000640071400010",2021,"PRE-DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS: METHODOLOGY APPLIED IN A PROPOSAL ORIENTED TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS","In a context of growing customer needs and requirements and worsening environmental issues, the Product Development Process must adapt to these circumstances, promoting measures that enable sustainable development, thus maintaining balance and synergy in the environmental, social and economic spheres. For this, it is essential to carry out the pre-development of business proposals. In this context, adopting a holistic approach that interrelates various areas of literature, brings together contributions in order to lead society to a resilient and resource-efficient environment. Thus, this research promotes the interrelationship between the Product Development Process and the Sustainable Development Goals and aims to realize the pre-development of a product under the perspective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). To meet the proposed objective, the methodology adopted consists of the adaptation of a pre-development model, selected through bibliographic analysis. The results of this research present the pre-development of a product willing to meet the goals of SDG 6 (drinking water and sanitation) and SDG 7 (accessible and clean energy). It highlights the use of tools to structure and ensure the assertiveness of the proposal, such as IDEF0, SWOT analysis and FMEA.","ENERGY; SDGS","Product Development Process; Pre-development; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals","RISUS-JOURNAL ON INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY","Kohlbeck, E##Melo, A##Fagundes, AB##Pereira, D##Beuren, FH##Ueno, OK","[Kohlbeck, Eloiza; Melo, Amanda; Fagundes, Alexandre Borges; Pereira, Delcio; Beuren, Fernanda Hansch; Ueno, Oscar Khoiti] Univ Estado Santa Catarina UDESC, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.","Management","Business & Economics","Aghaei Chadegani A., 2013, ASIAN SOCIAL SCI, V9, P18, DOI [10.5539/ass.v9n5p18, DOI 10.5539/ASS.V9N5P18]##Ahmed R, 2020, CHEM ENG SCI, V227, DOI 10.1016/j.ces.2020.115922##Alim MA, 2020, J CLEAN PROD, V270, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122437##Allen C, 2016, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V66, P199, DOI 10.1016/j.envsci.2016.09.008##Bayu T, 2020, WATER RESOUR RES, V56, DOI 10.1029/2019WR025330##Benabdellah AC, 2020, RES ENG DES, V31, P323, DOI 10.1007/s00163-020-00339-4##Beuren FH, 2013, J CLEAN PROD, V47, P222, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.12.028##Beuren Fernanda Hansch, 2017, Prod., V27, pe20170052, DOI 10.1590/0103-6513.20170052##Bonnardel N, 2020, APPL ERGON, V83, DOI 10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102987##Corallo A, 2020, INT J PROD RES, V58, P4789, DOI 10.1080/00207543.2020.1771455##Costa Marcela Avelina Bataghin, 2016, Gest.

This paper aims to increase readers? understanding of sustainable development challenges in Library and Information Science (LIS) in terms of complexity and diversity. A detailed plan was drawn up from Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) to achieve the objectives of this study. An inclusion and exclusion criteria was established and each study item passed through identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion before being placed in the final pool of items. This paper reviewed literature chosen from LISA, LISTA, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases spanning from 2000 to 2020. Findings revealed that there was diverse type of sustainable development challenges in Library and Information Science (LIS). Absence of sustainable strategies, lack of sustainable education in the LIS curriculum, operations, services and buildings designs and massive energy consumption due to long service hours of libraries were major challenges. More importantly, the rapid digital and technological advances have made libraries? current equipment irrelevant casting a large carbon footprint on the globe. Challenges to adaptation are compounded by clinging to old traditions and resistance to change which limit the ability to plan for long term sustainable development (SD) goals. There is need to remove these obstacles to accrue benefits for today and far reaching implications for the future. The study provides an integrative report to help library leaders and educational policy makers in Pakistan to apply SD initiatives more effectively according to the institutes? contextual needs. The results of this study will also help further the sustainability agenda in LIS by incorporating sustainability into the LIS curriculum.","GREENER LIBRARY; PUBLIC-LIBRARY; BUILDINGS; DESIGN; KNOWLEDGE","Sustainable development libraries; Sustainable literature reviews; Sustainable development challenges; Going green libraries","JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP","Khalid, A##Malik, GF##Mahmood, K","[Khalid, Ayesha; Mahmood, Khalid] Univ Punjab, Inst Informat Management, Lahore, Pakistan.

An instrument with four constructs (CSR-communication with stakeholders, CSR-knowledge management, CSR-strategy, and sustainable development) was prepared and served to entities from medium-sized enterprises. The collected data was analyzed by modeling the partial least squares structural equations using the least squares method. The results showed that all three constructs (CSR-communication with stakeholders, CSR-knowledge management, CSR-strategy) were positively and strongly associated with sustainable development model building in enterprises. The practical implications were intended to provide an understanding of behavior related to the development of business models oriented towards sustainable development in the small business sector. Research can help companies identify the advantages and disadvantages of retaining existing users and attracting new users by communicating with stakeholders, managing knowledge, and creating responsible strategies. This study enriches the literature by contributing to general knowledge about creating a model of sustainable development. Social reports on actions for sustainable development are of particular importance, and this topic is also important for the small and medium sized enterprises (SME) sector.","CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MEDIATING ROLE; ENGAGEMENT; CULTURE; VALUES","sustainable development; CSR communication; CSR strategy","SUSTAINABILITY","Stawicka, E","[Stawicka, Ewa] Warsaw Univ Life Sci WULS, Management Inst, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Ashrafi M, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/su12030760##Barry SJ, 2014, ENVIRON MANAGE, V53, P454, DOI 10.1007/s00267-013-0216-4##Blaszczak A., 2016, CO CANNOT FORGET CSR, P18##Calcagni F, 2019, SUSTAIN SCI, V14, P1309, DOI 10.1007/s11625-019-00672-1##CLARKSON MBE, 1995, ACAD MANAGE REV, V20, P92, DOI 10.2307/258888##Cook KA, 2019, J BUS FINAN ACCOUNT, V46, P494, DOI 10.1111/jbfa.12360##Davis K., 1975, BUSINESS SOC ENV RES, V3rd, P174##Du SL, 2016, J PROD INNOVAT MANAG, V33, P55, DOI 10.1111/jpim.12334##ElAlfy A, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/su12145544##Elkington J., 1997, CANNIBALS FORKS TRIP##Girdauskien L., 2012, PROCEDIA SOCIAL BEHA, V41, P15##Hair J.F., 2010, MULTIVARIATE DATA AN, P673##Hur WM, 2017, CORP SOC RESP ENV MA, V24, P620, DOI 10.1002/csr.1432##Jablonski A, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en13236445##Latapi Agudelo M.A., 2019, INT J CORP SOC RESPO, V4, P1, DOI [10.1186/s40991-018-0039-y, DOI 10.1186/S40991-018-0039-Y]##Lewandowska A, 2020, ECON SOCIOL, V13, P72, DOI 10.14254/2071-789X.2020/13-3/5##Liczmanska-Kopcewicz K, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11205808##Lim JS, 2017, PUBLIC RELAT REV, V43, P768, DOI 10.1016/j.pubrev.2017.06.007##Lozano R, 2015, CORP SOC RESP ENV MA, V22, P32, DOI 10.1002/csr.1325##Mandi OR, 2019, J BUS RES, V94, P320, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.02.013##Mariani M.M., 2016, TOURISM MANAGEMENT M, P1##Melo T, 2012, CORP SOC RESP ENV MA, V19, P11, DOI 10.1002/csr.260##Mikula B., 2006, KNOWLEDGE BASED ORG##Nidumolu R., 2013, HARV BUS REV, V41, P30, DOI [10.1109/EMR.2013.6601104, DOI 10.1109/EMR.2013.6601104]##Nonaka I., 1995, KNOWLEDGE CREATING C##Ode E, 2020, J INNOV KNOWL, V5, P209, DOI 10.1016/j.jik.2019.08.002##Paliszkiewicz J., 2019, LEADERSHIP TRUST KNO, P1##Ringle C., SMARTPLS 30##Rogall H., 2010, EC SUSTAINABLE DEV T, P112##Sajna I., 2019, INT J INNOV MANAG, V205, P313##Skrzypek E., 2015, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT, P210##Stawicka E., 2017, OECONOMIA, V16, P73, DOI [10.22630/ASPE.2017.16.3.35, DOI 10.22630/ASPE.2017.16.3.35]##Story J, 2015, BUS ETHICS, V24, P111, DOI 10.1111/beer.12084##Sztangret I, 2017, ANN U MARIAE CURIE S, V2, P253##Tang Z, 2012, J MANAGE STUD, V49, P1274, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01068.x##Taylor M, 2014, J PUBLIC RELAT RES, V26, P384, DOI 10.1080/1062726X.2014.956106##Tiwana A., 2000, KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, P1##Wheaton Blair, 1977, SOCIOLOGICAL METHODO, V8, P84##Witek-Crabb A., 2002, PARTNERSHIP RELATION, P252##Wold H., 1996, RES PAPERS STAT FEST, P411##World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, OUR COMM FUT, P1##Young W, 2017, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V117, P195, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.10.016##Yu YN, 2016, SOC SCI J, V53, P226, DOI 10.1016/j.soscij.2014.07.006",2,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM15","no","SDG.9#SDG.8"

The successful implantation of the UN's seventeenth Sustainable Development Goal will aid the execution and achievement of the other sixteen goals. This article explores the importance and viability of Sustainable Development Goal 17, using a case study based in Valencia, Spain. The study presents an illustrative stakeholder situation, where we see that there are conflicting interests among conservationists, fishermen, municipality representatives, and others. Data collection was done using desk-based research and semi-structured interviews. The interview process was performed between October 2018 and October 2019. In total, 21 different stakeholders were interviewed. For the data analyses, a stakeholder register, Power-Interest Matrices, and a stakeholder map were used, and, to complement the latter, narratives were developed. The different analyses showed that most project stakeholders supported the project, while there was really only one stakeholder, the fishermen themselves, who were reticent about participating. However, it was shown over time that, by developing a common vision with them, the fishermen came on board the project and collaborated with the scientists. Stakeholder engagement analyses are especially useful in the application of Sustainable Development Goals at the project level. Although this case study is specifically applicable to a marine conservation context, it may be extrapolated and applied to any other Sustainable Development Goals' context.",NA,"global alliances; stakeholder management; Sustainable Development Goals","SUSTAINABILITY","Bulmer, E##del Prado-Higuera, C","[Bulmer, Elena] EAE Business Sch, Dept Operat & Data Sci, Madrid Campus, Madrid 28002, Spain.

The capacity to collaborate globally on addressing these issues remains weak. This historical review of research on global learning for sustainable development (GLSD) aims to clarify the diverse directions that research on GLSD has taken, to present the historical development of the research area, and highlight emerging research issues. The review summarizes key findings of 53 peer-reviewed publications, published in English in the period 1994-2020 identified with the search terms ""global learning"" and ""sustainable development"", sustainability or GLSD, respectively. The review documented a gradually growing knowledge base, mostly authored by scholars located in the global North. Conclusions point to what we might achieve if we could learn from one another in new ways, moving beyond Northern-centric paradigms. It is also time to re-evaluate core assumptions that underlie education for sustainable development more generally, such as a narrow focus on formal learning institutions.

"J","WOS:000646621900005",2020,"T21 China 2050: A Tool for National Sustainable Development Planning","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda are a key focus for implementing the Sustainable Development (SD) concept. But generally speaking, SD goals and targets are continuously evolving, country specific, complex to implement, and are often given relatively short time horizons, such as the 15-year horizon for the SDGs. Many SD issues need a much longer time horizon as the policy interventions to deal with these issues can take decades before their effects become apparent, which is especially true for China. The T21 China 2050 is developed to study the long-term SD challenges and opportunities of the country. In its business-as-usual simulation to 2050, T21 China 2050 reveals some of the sustainability challenges facing China, including 1) aging population and labor force decline, 2) huge food imports, 3) land degradation and loss of arable land, 4) water shortages, 5) huge fossil fuel imports, and 6) carbon dioxide emissions. These SD issues are a subset of the SDGs specifically relevant to China over a time horizon well beyond 2030. The model is then used to test possible policy interventions in these six areas under two separate scenarios: Balanced and Narrowly Focused. The major results from these two scenarios are compared with those of the business-as-usual scenario. The simulations show that by adopting certain policy measures, China's path towards SD can be further improved. It also shows that a variety of policy measures can be selected and tested with the T21 China 2050 model for exploring the future SD prospects of the country. Specific policies recommended include: extension of retirement age, adjustment of the current family planning policy, protection of agriculture land, promotion of agricultural R&D to raise yield, improvement of public transportation to slow private vehicle ownership, increased investment in renewable energy, and water conservation.","DEVELOPMENT GOALS; SDGS","Sustainable development planning; Scenario comparison; SDGs","GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY","Qu, WS##Shi, WZ##Zhang, JZ##Liu, T","[Qu, Weishuang] Millennium Inst, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.

"J","WOS:000646628200004",2020,"Sustainable development problems and countermeasures: A case study of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a region with unique and distinctive natural landscapes and cultural characteristics and presents a useful case to improve understanding of sustainable development for regions with extreme environments and unique social backgrounds. Research has been conducted for small-scale regions, however there has been insufficient exploration of the problems and countermeasures for sustainable development in Tibet. This study analyzes different functional zones (urbanized zones, agricultural zones, pastoral zones and ecological security zones) of the QTP. Then it develops a sustainable livelihood index (SLI) based on the sustainable livelihood analysis framework resulting in three main findings. First, sustainable livelihoods vary greatly across functional zones. The SLI for farmers and herdsmen in the urbanized zones is the highest, with a value of 3.57, followed by the agricultural zones of 3.07. In comparison, the SLI values in the ecological security zones and pastoral zones are 2.92 and 2.85, respectively, indicating that the two zones present challenges for sustainable development in the QTP. Second, all counties had few natural, social or physical assets, indicating the need to expand assets to achieve sustainable livelihoods. Finally, urbanized and agricultural counties had more robust livelihood strategies than ecological and pastoral counties. In light of these results, strategic options have been formulated to promote sustainable development. These options include: accelerating construction of the third pole national park group; establishing a pattern of green mining; promoting the biological resources industry; and initiating a carbon trading market in the QTP.","LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES; RURAL LIVELIHOODS; ENVIRONMENT; FRAMEWORK","Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; Functional zone; Sustainable livelihood; Sustainable development","GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY","Zhao, YN##Chen, D##Fan, J","[Zhao, Yannan; Chen, Dong; Fan, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

This claim is reflected in the central position that infrastructure and industry occupy in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure has been described as fundamental to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. With this in mind, it is important to investigate how Goal 9 interacts with other SDGs. Informed by SDG interactions literature, this article considers emerging trade-offs between Goal 9 and other SDGs in East Africa - where infrastructure and industry are dominating development planning and financing. Based on in-depth, qualitative research along two new 'development corridors' in East Africa, we highlight the complexities and nuances of SDG interactions and offer insights into why certain SDGs are often prioritised over others.",NA,"sustainable development goals; SDG interactions; infrastructure; industry; development corridors; LAPSSET; Central Corridor","INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW","Bersaglio, B##Enns, C##Karmushu, R##Luhula, M##Awiti, A","[Bersaglio, Brock] Univ Birmingham, Int Dev Dept, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.

"J","WOS:000648164700001",2021,"Teachers' perspectives on sustainable development: the implications for education for sustainable development","The pursuit of sustainable development for individuals, societies, and nations is important for the global community given its emphasis on pursuing a harmonious balance between societal, economic, and environmental imperatives. With respect to formal education, teachers are critical agents in delivering sustainable development content, and facilitating skills and action competencies to achieve such goals. Consequently, understanding teachers' perspectives of sustainable development is necessary. This research utilised a survey design to gather views from 296 teachers from 12 high schools in rural and urban areas of Jamaica. The data revealed most teachers' views exhibited systems thinking perspectives. Additionally, the research found that, to a lesser extent, teachers associated citizen participation with sustainable development. These findings hold importance for the reorientation of teacher education as part of Education for Sustainable Development to ensure that critical issues surrounding sustainable development, such as the development of systems thinking and citizen participation, are emphasised.","FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE","Sustainable development; teachers; teacher education; education for sustainable development; Jamaica","ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH","Ferguson, T##Roofe, C##Cook, LD","[Ferguson, Therese; Roofe, Carmel; Cook, Loraine D.] Univ West Indies, Sch Educ, Kingston, Jamaica.","Education & Educational Research; Environmental Studies","Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Alberich T., 2004, EASY GUIDE CITIZEN P##Alexandersson, 2012, J TEACHER ED SUSTAIN, V14, P5, DOI [10.2478/v10099-012-0001-0, DOI 10.2478/v10099-012-0001-0]##Alshawa, 2016, J TEACHER ED SUSTAIN, V18, P21, DOI [10.1515/jtes-2016-0012, DOI 10.1515/jtes-2016-0012]##Burgener L, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V174, P821, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.263##Burns, 1992, PROSPECT, V7, P56##Cheung P, 2020, EUR PHYS EDUC REV, V26, P101, DOI 10.1177/1356336X19835240##Childs A., 2007, RES SCI TECHNOLOGICA, V25, P307, DOI [DOI 10.1080/02635140701535067, 10.1080/02635140701535067]##Chrystalbridge M., 2002, ED SUSTAINABLE DEV T##Collins-Figueroa, 2012, J ED SUSTAINABLE DEV, V6, P253, DOI [10.1177/0973408212475257, DOI 10.1177/0973408212475257]##Cross S., 2019, PRIMARY SCH TEACHERS##Darling-Hammond L, 2020, APPL DEV SCI, V24, P97, DOI 10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791##Down, 2011, CARIBBEAN J ED, V33, P39##Down, 2008, CARIBBEAN J ED, V30, P60##Down, 2015, APPL ENV ED COMMUNIC, V14, P105, DOI [10.1080/1533015X.2014.974852, DOI 10.1080/1533015X.2014.974852]##Down L., 2010, S AFRICAN J ENV ED, V27, P58##Ferguson, 2008, CARIBBEAN J ED, V30, P108##Ferguson T, 2020, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V21, P959, DOI 10.1108/IJSHE-12-2019-0353##Fischer E, 2020, EDUC PSYCHOL-UK, V40, P296, DOI 10.1080/01443410.2019.1675867##Gustafsson P, 2015, PROCD SOC BEHV, V167, P7, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.635##Hill, 2019, SDG4 QUALITY ED INCL##Hordatt Gentles, 2018, CARIBBEAN Q, V64, P149, DOI [10.1080/00086495.2018.1435346, DOI 10.1080/00086495.2018.1435346]##Jabareen Yosef, 2008, Environment Development and Sustainability, V10, P179, DOI 10.1007/s10668-006-9058-z##Jickling, 1994, TRUMPETER, V11, P1##Jickling B, 2000, WATER AIR SOIL POLL, V123, P467, DOI 10.1023/A:1005211410123##Kioupi V, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11216104##Krasny, 2020, ADV ENV ED PRACTICE##LAURIE R., 2016, J ED SUSTAINABLE DEV, V10, P226, DOI [DOI 10.1177/0973408216661442, 10.1177/0973408216661442]##Leal Filho W., 2019, ENCY SUSTAINABILITY, P1##Leicht A., 2018, ISSUES TRENDS ED SUS, P25##Loubser CP, 2015, INT J EDUC SCI, V8, P93##McKenzie S., 2018, MECH ACCELERATE IMPL##National Environmental Education Committee (NEEC), 1998, NAT ENV ED ACT PLAN##Nurse, 2007, J EDUC TEACHING, V33, P177, DOI [10.1080/02607470701259473, DOI 10.1080/02607470701259473]##Pennington MC, 1995, TESOL QUART, V29, P705, DOI 10.2307/3588171##Poza-Vilches M.F., 2019, ENERG SOURCE PART A, P1##Rieckmann M., 2018, ISSUES TRENDS ED SUS, P39##Robinson J, 2004, ECOL ECON, V48, P369, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.10.017##Sachs JD, 2012, LANCET, V379, P2206, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60685-0##Sadler TD, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P353, DOI 10.1002/tea.20142##Selby D, 2006, J GEOGR HIGHER EDUC, V30, P351, DOI 10.1080/03098260600717471##Sinakou E, 2019, ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN, V21, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10668-017-0032-8##Strachan G., 2009, HDB SUSTAINABILITY L, P1##Tatalovic Vorkapic, 2017, J TEACH ED SUSTAIN, V19, P121, DOI DOI 10.1515/JTES-2017-0018##Tulloch L., 2019, ENCY TEACHER ED, P1##UNESCO, 2014, UNESCO ROADM IMPL GL##United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ., 2012, ED SUST DEV SOURC##United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2018, GUID ED SUST DEV ED##United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2014, EM ISS SMALL ISL DEV##Van Langenhove, 2003, RETHINKING METHODS P, P143##Vukic T, 2019, PHILOS SOCIOLOGY PSY, V18, P131, DOI [10.22190/FUPSPH1903131V, DOI 10.22190/FUPSPH1903131V]##WALS Arjen, 2009, REV CONTEXTS STRUCTU##WCED, 1987, OUR COMM FUT##Yu, 2016, INT J EARLY CHILD, V48, P369, DOI [10.1007/s13158-016-0176-y, DOI 10.1007/S13158-016-0176-Y]",0,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM4","no","SDG.4#SDG.11#SDG.16"
"J","WOS:000650637400011",2021,"Technology Transfer Oriented to Sustainable Development: Barriers and Opportunities","The process of technology transfer is complex and involves a series of factors and variables. Within this process, it is common that transferor and transferee might face several barriers. Furthermore, processes involving innovation and technology transfer must consider the impacts for the sustainable development. Taking these aspects into account, this paper aims to identify the barriers and opportunities in technology transfer oriented to sustainable development. To reach this goal, a systematic review of literature was carried out using the methodology Methodi Ordinatio. A portfolio composed of 107 scientific articles was built. The results demonstrate the main barriers, among which we can mention unavailability of financial resources or subsidies to obtain or implement a certain technology, and bureaucracy to obtain these resources. On the other hand, some opportunities can also be found, like Clean Development Mechanism and policies and regulations that favour the adoption and diffusion of clean technologies. Thus, this paper contributes to the academy by exploring the interconnections of Technology Transfer and Sustainable Development in the literature. This paper also contributes to the presentation of knowledge resources - information regarding barriers and opportunities to technology transfer oriented to sustainable development - so that governments and decision makers could define policies and strategies for a more effective process.","CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM; LOW-CARBON INNOVATION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CDM PROJECTS;

Therefore, a desktop research, as well as an analysis of the engineering education curricula, have been conducted. The results of the research indicated to two possible approaches to the integration of sustainable development into the engineering curricula - in the form of special subjects dedicated to the problems of sustainable development in the engineering, or as an integrative approach which implies that sustainable development becomes an integral part of the entire curriculum. Subjects dedicated to sustainable development have been identified at all universities, but not at all faculties where engineers are educated in the Republic of Serbia, they are present at all levels of study (undergraduate, master, doctoral), as well as within applied, integrated and specialist studies, and by status they are most often elective. The results confirm that the engineering curricula open up towards the questions of sustainable development both in international context, and in higher education of the Republic of Serbia and as such, they can serve to the relevant ministries of education and science, universities and engineering faculties as a recommendation in which way to plan and design higher education of engineers in the future in order to provide overall support in the integration of sustainability into the engineering.","UNIVERSITY","engineers; education for sustainable development; curriculum","THERMAL SCIENCE","Nikolic, VM##Vukic, TM","[Nikolic, Vesna M.] Univ Nis, Fac Occupat Safety, Nish, Serbia.

Thus, the objective of this article was to discuss the conceptual and methodological evolution of environmental education towards the objectives of sustainable development. For this purpose, a historical trend analysis was developed based on a bibliographic and documentary review from the First World Conference on the Environment (1972), the challenges facing the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the 2030 Global Action Plan. Among the main results, it was verified that, since the emergence of environmental education, its motivation has been the search and construction of pedagogical alternatives focused on sustainability as a guiding principle.",NA,"Environmental education; environment; sustainable development; sustainable development goals; sustainability","REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD","Delgado, DLM##Santoyo, AH##Delgado, LHM##Vilardell, MC","[Marquez Delgado, Dora Lilia; Marquez Delgado, Luis Humberto] Univ Pinar del Rio Hermanos Saiz Montes Oca, Pinar Del Rio, Cuba.

"J","WOS:000655619900008",2021,"Linking reservoir ecosystems research to the sustainable development goals","Reservoirs account for about 10% of the freshwater stored in lakes worldwide. These reservoirs are home to 'reservoir ecosystems', that is, the aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes where water is stored, typically behind a dam, for human purposes. While reservoir ecosystems provide various ecosystem services for sustainable development, their significance in research and policy has not been well understood and not well defined in the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development. To advance understanding of reservoir ecosystems and their impact on policy, here we provide an overview of research on reservoir ecosystems and link it to UN SDGs and their Targets. Based on 5280 articles published in the last three decades, we applied network visualization to construct a framework for research addressing reservoir ecosystems. The framework covers four major themes: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management We have found that sustainable reservoir ecosystems synergistically support 121 Targets of UN SDGs (71% of all). Reservoir ecosystems have both negative and positive implications for 15 targets (9%) and negative trade-offs for only 3 targets (2%). Thirty SDG Targets (18%) are unrelated to sustainable reservoir ecosystems. The synergies and trade-offs exist in three fields, securing basic material needs (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15), pursuing common human well-being (SDGs 1, 3. 4, 5, 8 and 10), and coordinating sustainable governance policies (SDGs 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17).

"J","WOS:000655680400015",2021,"Evaluating Normandy's sustainable development and energy transition policies","Since 2012, France has been engaged in its energy and environmental policy transformation. The legislative framework for this change is the Energy transition for green growth Act. The policy on energy transition and sustainable development is carried out at the local level by the regions which rely on their territories. This paper aims to provide a useful tool to policy-makers in order to monitor sustainable development and energy transition policies in Norman territories. This first part of the research provides the evaluation's framework through an Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Index. The methodological strategy is based on a systematic literature survey on both academic work related to energy transition and sustainable development and the Normady's sustainable development and energy transition policies. Based on literature review, the study identified six policy-packages in which policy-makers may act: The ""environment and resources use"", the ""sustainable territories and mobility"", the ""energy security and transition"", the ""economic dynamics"", the ""governance dimension"" and the ""social dimension"". The index is built using the budget allocation process approach. Strengths and weaknesses of the index are clearly identified and highlighted in order to warn future users of the tool the cautions they should take in the implementation of the index, including challenges to make data available for such an implementation.

This paper draws on relevant materials to examine the challenges of sustainable development, especially within the context of the serious structural adjustment challenges in Africa. Against the backdrop of the continent's earlier dismal experiences with development initiatives, the paper assesses the promises of both Agenda 2063 and SDGs to motorize sustainable development in the continent. The paper contends that the feasibility of sustainable development in Africa is contingent upon the institutionalization of the active state. The imperative of the active state in development architecture is because of its indispensability in charting critical pathways for all-round sustainability.","MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; CHALLENGES; SECURITY; NEED","sustainability; sustainable development goals; agenda 2063; Africa","JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES","Nwozor, A##Okidu, O##Adedire, S","[Nwozor, Agaptus; Adedire, Solomon] Landmark Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Km 4 Ipetu Omu Aran Rd, Omu Aran 251101, Kwara State, Nigeria.

In this teaching case, the teaching method called PBL (Problem Based Learning) was used, considered innovative, and a relevant alternative to the traditional teaching model. The teaching case is a hypothetical situation that represents the reality of several regions in Brazil. The teaching case was applied to a discipline of the Stricto Sensu Graduate Program in Sustainability at a university in the southeast region of Brazil. Using the PBL method, this course sought to analyze the problem and propose solutions for the regional and local sustainable development project of RIDE-Plus Ultra. The study points out the need to establish municipal consortiums, the integration of local society, the formation and technopolitical training of social and public actors to support the implementation of actions and works aimed at the sustainable development of the territory. It is concluded that a social and political pact, with the participation of the population in short, medium and long-term projects, are fundamental to achieve an indispensable sustainable regional and local development.","PBL","Sustainable development Project; Teaching case; Problem based learning; Integrated development region; Regional and local sustainable development","REVISTA DE GESTAO E PROJETOS","de Benedicto, SC##Bittencourt, JJ##da Silva, CF##Sugahara, CR",NA,"Business","Business & Economics","Albagli S., 2006, INCLUSAO SOCIAL, V1, P17##Albarello C.

"J","WOS:000670889500013",2021,"LINKAGE BETWEEN TOURISM AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN URBAN AREAS","Purpose: Over the last decades, tourism has experienced continued growth, and its impact on economic activity can be observed through its effects on the balance of payments and the labour market, as well as connections with other economic activities. According to the ITB report (2016), urban tourism recorded the largest increase, noting that tourist arrivals in urban areas increased by 58% in the past five years. This was due to growing urbanization, better road accessibility and air connectivity between cities, shorter stays and an increasing number of trips per year. In recent years, the number of tourist arrivals in urban areas has also increased in Croatia. In 2018, over 12 million arrivals were recorded, which represents 64% of the total tourist arrivals for that year. Methodology: The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between tourism (tourism indicators) and sustainable development (investment in sustainable development) in cities in Croatia. The survey covered all 128 cities. The data analysis was conducted using descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney test and regression analysis. Results: The results show that there is a correlation between tourism and sustainable development in the analysed cities. Cities with thriving tourism pay more attention to sustainable development. Conclusion: It is necessary to continuously increase the levels of knowledge and understanding of tourism in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.","CITY TOURISM; INDICATORS; CITIES","Sustainable development; tourism; urban areas; Croatia","EKONOMSKI VJESNIK","Nizic, MK##Trinajstic, M##Grdic, ZS","[Nizic, Marinela Krstinic; Trinajstic, Masa; Grdic, Zvouimira Sverko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Opatija 51410, Croatia.","Economics","Business & Economics","Ashworth G, 2011, TOURISM MANAGE, V32, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2010.02.002##Aydin B, 2018, ASIA PAC J TOUR RES, V23, P975, DOI 10.1080/10941665.2018.1513049##Boschma R., 2016, WELCH EC REV, V24, P17##Burnett P., 2007, Journal of Regional Analysis and Policy, V37, P233##Chandan S, 2019, J URBAN MANAG, V8, P472, DOI 10.1016/j.jum.2019.05.001##Coles T., 2003, Tourism Geographies, V5, P190, DOI 10.1080/1461668032000068306##Dias N, 2014, PROC ECON FINANC, V18, P497, DOI 10.1016/S2212-5671(14)00968-X##Edwards D, 2008, ANN TOURISM RES, V35, P1032, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2008.09.002##Romero-Garcia LE, 2019, TOUR REV, V74, P679, DOI 10.1108/TR-06-2018-0085##European Commission, 2016, SMART CITIES COMMUNI##Garau C, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su10030575##Horvat J., 2013, PROSTOR SCHOLARLY J, V21, P292##Hueting R, 2004, ECOL ECON, V50, P249, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.03.031##Huovila A, 2019, CITIES, V89, P141, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2019.01.029##IPK International, 2016, ITB WORLD TRAVEL TRE##Jurdana DS, 2006, TOUR HOSP MANAG-CROA, V12, P135##Klopp JM, 2017, CITIES, V63, P92, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2016.12.019##Krstinic Nizic M., 2019, BUSINESS EXCELLENCE, V13, P35, DOI [10.22598/pi-be/2019.13.1.35, DOI 10.22598/PI-BE/2019.13.1.35]##Krstinic Nizic M., 2016, J POLYTECHNIC RIJEKA, V4, P45##Krstinic Nizic M., 2019, WIT T ECOLOGY ENV SU, P443##Lee JW, 2013, TOURISM MANAGE, V38, P69, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2013.02.016##Li R, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su11185074##Mccann P, 2015, REG STUD, V49, P1291, DOI 10.1080/00343404.2013.799769##Mirkov A, 2012, SOCIOLOGIJA, V54, P55, DOI 10.2298/SOC1201055M##Novy J, 2019, TOUR PLAN DEV, V16, P358, DOI 10.1080/21568316.2019.1577293##Novy J, 2019, INT J TOUR CITIES, V5, P63, DOI 10.1108/IJTC-01-2018-0011##Page S.

In this context, Green Campus Initiatives were set up at four Brazilian universities to promote student engagement in finding ways to incorporate sustainability in the way the university operates. This article aims to identify whether the Green Campus Initiatives is a viable strategy for disseminating sustainable development concepts in higher education institutions, enhancing the students' knowledge and proactivity regarding sustainable development. This quantitative-descriptive study was based on data collected in a survey involving students from four Brazilian universities, with a sample of 1013 respondents. The data were analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. The results show that sustainable development dissemination strategies in higher education institutions explain around 18% of the students' level of proactivity and 27.7% of their knowledge and awareness regarding sustainable development. The findings of this study could aid planning in higher education institutions aimed at implementing environmentally sustainable practices at universities based on student perceptions.","DELFT-UNIVERSITY; IMPLEMENTATION; STRATEGIES; TOOL","Sustainable development dissemination; Green campus initiatives; Green universities; Higher education; Sustainability","JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION","Ribeiro, JMP##Hoeckesfeld, L##Magro, CBD##Favretto, J##Barichello, R##Lenzi, FC##Secchi, L##de Lima, CRM##Guerra, JBSOD","[Ribeiro, Joao Marcelo Pereira] Santa Catarina State Univ, Publ Policies & Dev, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

"J","WOS:000674237500024",2021,"Sustainable Development in Agriculture and its Antecedents, Barriers and Consequences-An Exploratory Study","This study aims to understand Brazilian family farmers' perception of sustainable development in agriculture, its antecedents, barriers and consequences. To do so, qualitative, exploratory research was adopted, interviewing 23 farmers. For data collection, an interview script was elaborated followed by content analysis. The results showed that farmers perceived sustainable development in agriculture from 25 definitions. The study identified 19 antecedents of sustainability in agriculture; 20 barriers hindering sustainable development in agriculture; and 14 consequences of more sustainable agriculture. This research contributes to in-depth reflection about the meaning of sustainable development in agriculture, associated with its antecedents, barriers and consequences for agriculture. The results reinforce that conceptualizing and understanding what sustainable development is, is a process and this concept can vary from one context to another. This study aimed specifically to examine Brazilian family farming from the perspective of sustainability. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To monitor the progress of sustainable development, the United Nations launched Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. Subsequently, nations of the world have drawn up a list of localized indicators regarding the United Nations SDGs as a paradigm. We established a database including SDGs indicator systems of 11 economies by collecting and determining a large number of materials. Based on this database, we analyzed SDGs indicators by designing a conceptual framework of comparative analysis that included three views. We found that the SDGs indicator systems of 11 economies are different between the number of indicators, the proportion of different categories, and the connotation of indicators. Although the SDGs indicator systems among economies regarded the United Nations SDGs as a framework and included the major social problems related to sustainability, the inconsistency between SDGs indicator systems is large. It is a major reason why scholars lack the systematic method for developing indicators. There are challenges faced in data accessibility. The framework for comparative analysis could be applied to different economies.","INDEX; CHINA","Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); framework; indicator; cross-national; database","CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE","Wang, XY##Song, CQ##Cheng, CX##Ye, SJ##Shen, S","[Wang, Xiangyu] Beijing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

"J","WOS:000675470300002",2021,"Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Development in China","This paper examines artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainable development in China. The Chinese government has developed ambitious policies for global leadership in the field of AI and sustainable development. While China has made progress in several areas of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is lagging behind in achieving the SDGs overall, and AI technologies can bolster its progress toward SDGs. Using the latest data of 193 countries around the world, the paper also analyzes the implication of AI on sustainable development both at the global and regional levels. Broadly, a strong positive relationship between the government AI readiness and progress toward SDGs is observed. When classifying the SDGs into four dimensions including economy, society, environment, and partnerships, government AI readiness is found to have a strong relationship with economy followed by the society dimension, whereas there are no clear relationships with the environment and partnerships dimensions. To fully harness and scale the power of AI to meet the SDGs, the Chinese policy maker should align the potential AI technologies to address its SDGs gap, and identify the priority or targeted areas and design appropriate business models and incentive structures for scaling viable solutions. AI technologies, when implemented strategically and properly, can accelerate China's progress toward SDGs.","WATER","Sustainable development; sustainable development goals (SDGs); artificial intelligence; China","CHINESE ECONOMY","Liengpunsakul, S","[Liengpunsakul, Subin] Bank Thailand, Data Analyt Off, Bangkok, Thailand.","Economics","Business & Economics","Acemoglu D., 2017, ROBOTS JOBS EVIDENCE ROBOTS JOBS EVIDENCE##Bughin J., 2018, MODELING IMPACT AI W MODELING IMPACT AI W##Chou JS, 2018, ECOL INFORM, V44, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.01.005##Chui M., 2018, NOTES AI FRONTIER AP##Delahunt CB, 2015, P 5 IEEE GLOB HUM, P393##Lakhani P, 2017, RADIOLOGY, V284, P574, DOI 10.1148/radiol.2017162326##Lo YL, 2019, CHIN ECON, V52, P387, DOI 10.1080/10971475.2019.1617925##Miller H., 2019, GOVT ARTIFICIAL INTE##Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2019, CHIN PROGR REP IMPL CHIN PROGR REP IMPL##Mohanty SP, 2016, FRONT PLANT SCI, V7, DOI 10.3389/fpls.2016.01419##Mossad A, 2018, ARAB J GEOSCI, V11, DOI 10.1007/s12517-018-3487-5##Purdy M., 2016, WHY ARTIFICIAL INTEL##PWC, 2018, MACR IMP ART INT MACR IMP ART INT##Sachs J., 2019, SUSTAINABLE DEV REPO##Takayama L., 2008, ACM IEEE INT C HUM R ACM IEEE INT C HUM R##Tortoise Intelligence, 2019, GLOB AI IND GLOB AI IND##UNDESA, 2020, UN E GOV SURV 2020 UN E GOV SURV 2020##United Nations, 2020, SUSTAINABLE DEV GOAL##Vinuesa R, 2020, NAT COMMUN, V11, DOI 10.1038/s41467-019-14108-y##Vorosmarty CJ, 2010, NATURE, V467, P555, DOI 10.1038/nature09440##World Economic Forum, 2020, UNL TECHN GLOB GOALS UNL TECHN GLOB GOALS",0,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM15","no","SDG.17#SDG.9"
"J","WOS:000683760600024",2021,"Intercultural Education and Sustainable Development. A Crucial Nexus for Contribution to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development","Over the last few years, research in the educational field has conducted specific and broad analysis of intercultural education, with a solid theoretical basis and an advanced body of empirical research. However, the link between an intercultural approach and the theme of sustainable development, which has recently become an important aspect of international educational policies, remains less explored. The publication of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the definition of the goals for the millennium has made it necessary to deepen this link. The article aims to expand on the connection between intercultural education and sustainable development, highlighting the potential for the intercultural approach to contribute to reaching the objectives of the 2030 Agenda.

The results indicate GDP per capita has a positive weak effect on life satisfaction in both developed and developing countries. Moreover, although the positive strong impact of sustainable development on life satisfaction is confirmed in developed countries, this hypothesis is rejected in developing countries. Finally, the hypothesis indicating an inverse U relationship between economic growth and sustainable development with life satisfaction is confirmed in developed countries; however, it is rejected in developing countries. Hence, in developing countries social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development along with improvement in democracy and corruption control should not be ignored to promote happiness. Moreover, in developed countries for avoiding a decrease in happiness, social, economic, political and environmental empowering-encouraging policies should be simultaneously pursued by policy makers.","ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; INCOME; EMPLOYMENT","economic growth; sustainable development; life satisfaction; dynamic panel model","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS AND DEVELOPMENT","Fotourehchi, Z","[Fotourehchi, Zahra] Univ Mohaghegh Ardabili, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, POB 56199-11367, Ardebil, Iran.","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Social Sciences - Other Topics","Abounoori E., 2006, J EC POLICY, V15, P37##ANDERSON TW, 1981, J AM STAT ASSOC, V76, P598, DOI 10.2307/2287517##ARELLANO M, 1991, REV ECON STUD, V58, P277, DOI 10.2307/2297968##ARELLANO M, 1995, J ECONOMETRICS, V68, P29, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01642-D##Bartolini S., 2011, HAPPY LONG SOCIAL CA, V621##Beja E., 2018, J BEHAV EC POLICY, V2, P79##Benz M, 2008, ECONOMICA, V75, P362, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0335.2007.00594.x##Blundell R, 1998, J ECONOMETRICS, V87, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00009-8##Caporale GM, 2009, J ECON PSYCHOL, V30, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.joep.2008.06.004##De Botton A, 2000, CONSOLATIONS PHILOS##Easterlin R., 1974, NATIONS HOUSEHOLDS E##EASTERLIN RA, 1995, J ECON BEHAV ORGAN, V27, P35, DOI 10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-B##Easterlin RA, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P11176, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1633144100##Fotourehchi Z, 2019, INT J HAPPINESS DEV, V5, P1##Frey BS, 2000, ECON J, V110, P918, DOI 10.1111/1468-0297.00570##Graham C, 2008, HAPPINESS WORLD##Gropper D.M., 2011, CATO J, V31, P237##Hannan M.T., 1992, DYNAMICS ORG POPULAT##Hasan Esmail H.A., 2018, ASIAN SOCIAL SCI, V14, P78, DOI [10.5539/ass.v14n3p.78, DOI 10.5539/ASS.V14N3P.78]##Inglehart I., 2009, HAPPINESS EC POLITIC, V11##Kenny C, 1999, KYKLOS, V52, P3, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6435.1999.tb00576.x##Knabe A, 2010, ECON LETT, V107, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2009.12.032##Li B., 2009, IEEE INT CONF CLOUD, P17##Li Q, 2020, J HAPPINESS STUD, V21, P485, DOI 10.1007/s10902-019-00092-z##Lindenberg S., 1993, INTERDISCIPLINARY PE##Mbaku J.M, 1996, CATO J, V16, P99##Pearce D., 2007, ELGAR COMPANION DEV, P615##Pennock M, 2011, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, V31, P61, DOI 10.1016/j.eiar.2010.04.003##Potts J., 2016, J ARTS HUMANITIES, V5, P86, DOI [10.18533/journal.v5i3.91, DOI 10.18533/JOURNAL.V5I3.91]##Rodrik D, 1997, DEMOCRACY EC P UNPUB##Rothstein B, 2010, 9 U GOTH QUAL GOV I##Ryan J.B., 2019, DOES EC GROWTH ABSOL, DOI [10.2139/ssrn.3509354, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.3509354]##Sabatini F, 2014, SOC SCI MED, V114, P178, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.05.024##Sacks DW, 2012, EMOTION, V12, P1181, DOI 10.1037/a0029873##Sameem S, 2019, APPL ECON LETT, V26, P1049, DOI 10.1080/13504851.2018.1529390##Sandholtz W, 2000, INT STUD QUART, V44, P31, DOI 10.1111/0020-8833.00147##Slag M., 2019, INT REV EC, V66, P325, DOI [10.1007/s12232-019-00325-w, DOI 10.1007/S12232-019-00325-W]##Steptoe A, 2019, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V40, P339, DOI 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040218-044150##Stevenson B., 2008, BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC, V1, P1, DOI 10.1353/eca.0.0001##The World Bank, 2019, WORLD DEV IND WDI##Veenhoven R, 1989, UNDERSTANDING EC BEH, V11, P9##Veenhoven R., 2005, J HAPPINESS STUD, V6, P351, DOI [10.1007/s10902-005-0003-x, DOI 10.1007/S10902-005-0003-X]##Winkelmann R., 2014, IZA WORLD LABOR, V94, DOI [10.15185/izawol.94, DOI 10.15185/IZAWOL.94]",0,"2021-09-03",NA,"COM6","no","SDG.12#SDG.17"
"J","WOS:000686590300019",2021,"NANOECONOMICS AND INNOVATIVE MARKETING AS FACTORS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT","The relevance of the research topic is determined by the fact that the world is changing towards the environmental situation deterioration: ozone holes, air pollution and water contamination, food crisis and many natural disasters. These problems must be solved at all possible levels - global, local and individual. The object of the research is defined as influence of nanoeconomics on the sustainable development of different national economics and world economy in general. The peculiarities of the global environment in the context of sustainable development should be outlined at these levels and mainly at the level of nanoeconomics. The purpose of the study is to identify the individual innovative factor in global sustainable development. The subject of research is nanoeconomics in the framework innovative marketing of global sustainable development. The main research methods are a systematic approach and structural analysis, comparison and observation, mathematical methods (regression analysis, in particular). The results of the study include the assessment of three sustainable development components (economic, ecological and social), their impact on the quality of the global environment, nanoeconomics and innovative marketing. The results obtained can be used in the elaboration of state programs for sustainable development with the focus on the global, national and individual levels as well as on the education and upbringing in different educational establishments from preschool institutions to corporate universities. Sustainable development of the countries studied is determined by the high rates of the environmental protection policy. Although the environmental pollution is still ongoing, there is a tendency of a less hazardous impact on the natural world. Waste is recycled rather than utilized, which is an act of the consumer system improvement when not only brand new goods and services are purchased but also those that can easily be processed. Such policy reflects an economically frugal approach to the environmental development. To sum up, the social component is crucial for sustainable development since all the countries under study are highly developed and the poverty is not a decisive factor of the development with the food problem solved long ago. However, helping those in need becomes the basis for the governmental and the private sector activity. These issues are resolved with the implementation of the Agenda 2030. Hence, the global sustainable development goals are subject to the economic, social and environmental factors of nanoeconomic evolution in the countries studied.","POLICY","global environment; sustainable development; nanoeconomics; innovative marketing; global sustainable development goals; agenda","BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES","Ostapenko, T##Kolesnyk, M","[Ostapenko, Tetiana; Kolesnyk, Maksym] Natl Aviat Univ, Kiev, Ukraine.","Economics","Business & Economics","Asian Development Bank, 2017, FIR REG BRAIN NETW P##Bill Schmarzo, EC DATA ANAL DIGITAL##Brendan Coates, 2017, CHINAS EMERGENCE GLO##Brodhag C, 2006, NAT RESOUR FORUM, V30, P136, DOI 10.1111/j.1477-8947.2006.00166.x##Browning MHEM, 2019, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V16, DOI 10.3390/ijerph16030429##Chandran Nair, 2020, DERZHAVA STALOHO ROZ##Estrada F, 2017, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V7, P403, DOI [10.1038/nclimate3301, 10.1038/NCLIMATE3301]##Feng W, 2013, POPUL DEV REV, V38, P115, DOI 10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00555.x##Hylton K.

"J","WOS:000687767000002",2021,"Sustainable development of territorial units: MCDM approach with optimal tail selection","In the face of accelerating climate change, economic instability and limited resources, it is essential to find indicators that better measure the sustainable development of territorial units. Despite ambiguous definitions of sustainable development, numerous studies describe quantitative indicators of sustainable development. Main methodological problems include data availability and their use, spatial and time scales, selection of indicators, and their aggregation. Usually, analysts and decision-makers apply well known conventional methods that have numerous limitations. These methods in many cases cause excessive simplification of the real phenomena and relations between their determinants. Moreover, variables describing the development of territorial units (especially the environmental pillar) are often characterized by strong asymmetry or extreme observations. Even a single outlier for a given territorial unit may significantly affect the analysis and the resulting conclusions. The objective of this paper is to present the application potential of a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach with an optimal tail selection to assess the sustainable development of territorial units. The proposed approach is based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and different methods of optimal tail selection of variable distribution. The Oja's spatial median and the optimal tail selection methods are used to reduce the impact of strong asymmetry and extreme values of variables. Moreover, the measure of cluster compactness is proposed for the evaluation of the proposed method. The proposed approach was used to assess the sustainable development of municipalities in Poland in 2018. We found that the automated Eye-Ball method and the Guillou and Hall's method enabled correct identification of extreme values of variables describing the economic, social, and environmental development of municipalities. This made it possible to distinguish the types of sustainable development level and its pillars and enabled to provide the statuses of the sustainable development level of the examined municipalities with respect to other municipalities in Poland.","HUMAN-DEVELOPMENT INDEX; INDICATORS; THRESHOLD; PROPOSAL; CHINA; GOALS","MCDM; TOPSIS; Extreme values; Sustainable development","ECOLOGICAL

"J","WOS:A1993KL47600004",1993,"SPATIAL SYSTEMS-APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - A CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK","Even though ''sustainable development'' seems to have emerged as the development paradigm of the 1990s, a great deal of vagueness still surrounds the meaning, definition, and theoretical underpinnings of the concept. There is also a general lack of emphasis on the spatial dimension of sustainable development when developing relevant conceptual or environmental accounting frameworks. In clarifying the concept, this article proposes a definition that explicitly incorporates the temporal as well as the spatial dimension of sustainability. It also develops a logically consistent conceptual framework for the analysis and evaluation of sustainable development, following a spatial systems approach. Five interconnected aspatial subsystems or subsets of a spatial system are identified and their respective operational dimensions discussed. A proposed composite index called degree of stainable development (DSD) and its five component indicators are also outlined. The difficulties involved in operationalizing the DSD measure and the conceptual framework are noted, and the various tasks that need to be undertaken in this regard are specified. It is concluded that future research utilizing the proposed conceptual framework should not only foster the development of appropriate methodologies for the comparative evaluation of sustainable development at global, national, or regional scales, but also offer insights to appropriate decision makers at various levels regarding available options and alternative actions for the healthy development of their respective societies.","WORLD","DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING; RESOURCE; SPATIAL SYSTEM; SUSTAINABILITY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","NIU, WY##LU, JJ##KHAN, AA","CHINESE ACAD SCI,CTR ECONENVIRONM SCI,BEIJING,PEOPLES R CHINA.

Principles and best practice are discussed, both in general terms and as challenges to professionals involved with the coordinated planning and management of river catchments. Points are illustrated with reference to experience in the highly developed River Thames catchment, where the many demands made on the water environment require complex multifunctional decision-making. Sustainability offers a new paradigm and common language to support decision-making for sustainable development. The appropriate institutional and legislative framework will be supported by tools such as environmental appraisal, strategic environmental assessment and economic instruments. Within this context, the implicit partnership between asset management planning, catchment management planning and land-use planning has the potential to deliver sustainable development for the water environment, through a process which may be called 'total' catchment planning. It is suggested that source control will play a major role in the search for 'prevention rather than cure' as a basic principle of sustainability.",NA,"CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT PLANS; DEVELOPMENT PLANNING; SOURCE CONTROL; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; TOTAL CATCHMENT PLANNING; WATER USE MANAGEMENT","JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","GARDINER, JL",NA,"Environmental Sciences; Limnology; Water Resources","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources","[Anonymous], 1987, OUR COMMON FUTURE##BEALE DC, 1992, J INST WATER ENV MAN, V6, P141##BROOKE JS, 1991, P MINISTRY AGR FISHE##COLLETT LC, 1992, P WAT C WATER SUSTAI##Cunningham G.

Moreover, geography's perspective can help to address the pressing need for a stronger theoretical basis for understanding sustainable development.

Nevertheless, applied planning approaches appropriate to this task have been slow in forthcoming. This paper suggests that one avenue for the application of sustainable development principles to resource management problems may be through multi-dimensional decision-support models. This approach recognizes that contemporary decision problems in the field of environmental planning are characterized by a diversity of structures and processes, incommensurable variables, and conflicting development objectives and constraints. On the basis of the articulated approach to sustainable development, a case study centred on Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada is presented. The case study serves to illustrate the efficacy of a multidimensional decision-support approach to sustainable development.","INDICATORS","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MULTICRITERIA ANALYSIS; OPTIMIZATION; CLAYOQUOT SOUND","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","HARTE, MJ##LONERGAN, SC","UNIV WAIKATO,DEPT GEOG,HAMILTON,NEW ZEALAND.

Until 'green accounting' and similar systems are made available and are implemented, the sustainability indicator will be the most effective tool available for monitoring progress towards a more sustainable society. Sustainability indicators are already available but are characterized by a poor or absent theoretical underpinning. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a methodological framework that can be applied to the construction of indicators of sustainable development. In order to be consistent with widely accepted definitions of sustainable development, considerations relating to the measurement of quality of life and ecological integrity are central to the methodology. The methodological framework has relevance to a variety of spatial scales and to geographically diverse areas (urban or rural, developed or developing countries) so that a suite of sustainability indicators can be produced that is tailored to the needs and resources of the indicator user, but which remains rooted firmly in the fundamental principles of sustainable development.",NA,"SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INDICATOR; QUALITY OF LIFE; ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; AGENDA 21; PICABUE","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY","MITCHELL, G##MAY, A##MCDONALD, A","UNIV LEEDS,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.

"J","WOS:A1996UG93200003",1996,"Sustainable development: Looking for new strategies","Many strategies have been proposed to reach sustainable development. A great many of these strategies aim at one type of problem-preventing environmental deterioration-while ignoring the importance of economic or social goals. In addition, while political decisions are at the heart of the choices to be made, most researchers seem to consider sustainable development as a mere technical problem. In this paper we describe a more complete strategy for sustainable development. We use the outlines of this strategy to find out what knowledge and skills are still needed. The strategy is based on the idea that it is necessary to find consensus on the development of a socio-environmental system as a whole, and between all people involved. It leaves us with at least two main areas that need further study: the supply of information and the management of consensus building. A formal procedure for consensus building might be developed based on the literature and on experiences with Environmental Impact Assessments. Special attention is paid to the information needed. It can be summarized as information about: (1) delimiting a socio-environmental system; (2) the needs and wants to be satisfied via that system; and (3) the physical, ecological, economic, social and cultural constraints of satisfying those needs and wants.","ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS","sustainable development; socio-environmental system; decision-making; information","ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS","deGraaf, HJ##Musters, CJM##terKeurs, WJ",NA,"Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics","Archibugi F., 1990, EC ECOLOGY SUSTAINAB##BARBIER E, 1989, EC NATURAL RESOURCE##Beck U., 1992, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI##BECKERMAN W, 1994, ENVIRON VALUE, V3, P191, DOI 10.3197/096327194776679700##BOOTH DE, 1994, ECOL ECON, V9, P241, DOI 10.1016/0921-8009(94)90081-7##Common M., 1992, Ecological Economics, V6, P7, DOI 10.1016/0921-8009(92)90036-R##COMMON MS, 1993, ENVIRON VALUE, V2, P299, DOI 10.3197/096327193776679846##COSTANZA R, 1991, ENV SUSTAINABLE EC D##Daly H.

"J","WOS:A1996VX13600011",1996,"Sustainable development principles and their implications for transport","'Sustainable mobility' has been adopted as an overall objective for European transport policy, and similar intentions are expressed in other parts of the world. However, little has been done to define what 'sustainable mobility' would actually imply for our understanding and assessment of transport. We suspect that this much used term could merely end up acting as a lubricant to the very development it was meant to challenge: The ever increasing movement of people and goods. In this article we attempt to place transport in the context of sustainable development principles. We emphasise the need to include principles of development (increasing well-being and equity) as well as sustainability (preserving natural and man-made capital). Four such principles are suggested, taking inspiration from Herman Daly and others. We then turn to explore the main features of transport, establishing a comprehensive transport concept. The concept combines a systems perspective with a service perspective. Omitting either one would disable a complete consideration of sustainable development. Our confrontation of the four principles with the reality of current transport trends gives rise to several critical implications. The most important of which relate to the contribution of transport to depleting natural capital and quality of life. Moreover, we are also forced to challenge the value of increasing mobility itself, if other forms of access may provide relevant substitutes. The article thereby outlines some conceptual foundations for a transport policy that could qualify as sustainable.",NA,"sustainable development principles; transport; mobility; accessibility","ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS","Gudmundsson, H##Hojer, M","NATL ENVIRONM RES INST, DK-4000 ROSKILDE, DENMARK.

"J","WOS:A1996WL65600006",1996,"Core values for sustainable development","The cultural norms or core values for sustainable development are an amalgamation of core social values and core environmental values. Widely-shared core social values became strikingly articulated following the Second World War via such instruments as the 1948 Genocide Convention and the 1948 Human Rights Declaration. By contrast, widely-shared core environmental values did not surface until some two decades after the Second World War, being first clearly expressed in the 1972 Stockholm Declaration, to be followed by the 1982 World Charter for Nature and, more recently, by the 1992 Rio Declaration. I find that whereas the emerging core social values have until quite recently been essentially innocent of environmental concerns, the emerging core environmental Values have been from the start generally couched in social terms. Key ethical issues regarding the cultural norms underlying sustainable development include the questions of how to strike a proper balance between anthropocentric and ecocentric justifications; and a proper apportionment of the global biosphere between humankind and the other life on earth. Several lines of evidence suggest to me that the environmental and social strands of widely-shared core values for sustainable development are beginning to merge, and that there has begun to occur a slow but progressive development in mainstream thinking toward a recognition of an unbreakable link between social development anal environmental conservation. A number of major stumbling blocks to the achievement of sustainable development exist of course, amongst them the imbalance between human numbers plus needs and available natural resources, the prevalence of totalitarian and corrupt regimes, and the ineffective system of peaceful world governance. Despite obstacles to sustainable development, a trend towards a commitment to it seems evident in such components of society as governments, intergovernmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia, religious bodies, and grass-roots movements.","ENVIRONMENT","cultural norms; environmental ethics; environmental values; social values; spiritual mores; sustainable development","ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION","Westing, AH",NA,"Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","[Anonymous], 1986, ASS DECL MESS MAN NA##BLOOM DE, 1995, SCIENCE, V269, P354, DOI 10.1126/science.269.5222.354##Buege DJ, 1996, ENVIRON ETHICS, V18, P71, DOI 10.5840/enviroethics199618144##CALLICOTT JB, 1982, ENVIRON ETHICS, V4, P293, DOI 10.5840/enviroethics1982443##Catton W.
